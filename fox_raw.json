Republican establishment frontrunner Jeb Bush is trying to show that he can be as good at running for president as his older brother. The former Florida governor is even using a similar outreach to evangelical voters to replicate George W. Bush’s 2000 success. But for Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, the question is instead how he can differ from his famous father, former Texas Rep. Ron Paul, who unsuccessfully sought the GOP nomination in 2008 and 2012. As the younger Paul makes ready for his Tuesday announcement, his campaign offers a trailer-style video in which he promises to be “a different kind of Republican.” His father was certainly that. The question for the son is whether he can be more successful.\n[Watch Fox: Chris Stirewalt joins “The Real Story” in the 2 p.m. ET hour with the latest on who’s up and who’s down in the 2016 Power Index.]\nAs the latest round of polls shows, Paul is in about the same spot his dad was in 2012: lots of buzz and fired-up grassroots support but with numbers in the high single digits. Can he change the trajectory and broaden his appeal without losing the core libertarian support he inherited from his father? How does Paul reach out to get in the top tier without seeing his base crumble underneath him? So far, Paul has been given remarkable latitude to reach a truce with the GOP establishment and to even modify stances on core positions, particularly with a recent call for a huge hike in Defense spending. There’s danger, though, in the form of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who has publicly feuded with Paul in the past and is now targeting the same group of voters as Paul. While Paul has latitude in dealing with ultra-hawk Cruz, Cruz will certainly be poised to hit Paul for any other perceived apostasies. Cruz’s candidacy will be a limiting reagent for Paul’s.\nPaul’s best argument in the months to come will likely center on general-election viability. If his core supporters and media backers can keep Paul in the game through the early debate rounds, he can position himself as a chance worth taking for a party desperate to regain the White House. As last week’s Quinnipiac University polls show, Paul connects with the general electorate in a way that frontrunners Bush and Gov. Scott Walker struggle to do. If there is a problem at the top of the pack and Paul has maintained his viability through the first furlongs of the race, he might end up in the discussion. At the very least, Paul is poised to be near the top of the short list for running mates, particularly if Bush is the nominee. And wouldn’t that be fitting? Rand Paul would help Jeb Bush exorcise the foreign policy problems he inherited from brother while Jeb Bush helped Rand Paul unload the baggage from his famous name.\nGraham praises Hillary, disses Rand - During an appearance on CBS’ “Face the Nation”, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he wanted to blow up the nuclear deal with Iran so President Obama’s successor could start over: “The best deal, I think, comes with a new president. Hillary Clinton would do better. I think everybody on our side, except maybe Rand Paul, could do better,” Graham said.\nFIRST IN FOX NEWS FIRST: HUCKABEE TARGETS MIDDLE CLASS WITH ‘MAXIMUM WAGE’\nIn his first in a series of videos, former Gov. Mike Huckabee, R-Ark, makes his pitch to the middle class by offering his solutions to low wages and high unemployment. In the video provided first to Fox News First, Huckabee shares the story of an unemployed Texas woman who states, “I don’t have to be on welfare because I know if you believe and you have faith it will come.” In casting his vision for what he calls a “maximum wage” Huckabee appears saying, “I’m not a Republican because I grew up rich, I’m a Republican because I didn’t want to spend the rest of my life poor, waiting for the government to rescue me,” adding, “Instead of fighting over the minimum wage, why don’t we focus on solutions that help every American earn his or her maximum wage.” Huckabee takes a back seat to no one in the GOP field on social issues, but has a greater gift for making his case without saying incendiary things.

Governor Kim Reynolds, R-Iowa, joins Chris Stirewalt to talk about how the issues important to winning over Iowans reflect the same concerns of the national electorate.  WATCH HERE\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\nBaseball is back. Big-league play got underway Sunday night with a shutout victory by the St. Louis Cardinals over the Chicago Cubs in an, um, inauspicious beginning of a new era for Wrigley Field. And as the rest of the teams hit the field today, we’ll get to see lots of Americana on display (WashEx offers an impressive catalogue of presidential first pitches) and baseball fans everywhere will deeply delight. But for those of you baseball haters – and we know you are legion – perhaps consider this meditation from Michael Brendan Dougherty on the virtues of the game in this era of acrimony: “Because unlike nearly every other part of American life right now, in baseball, the rules and stakes are relatively clear. At the end of the game there is no dispute over who won or lost. The teams and their fans do not get to walk away with a conflicting set of facts. The greatness of an opponent is a threat only to your team, not to your sense of self-worth, or your feeling of membership in your country.”\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Finney has been part of Clinton’s shadow campaign network since last year following the cancellation of Finney’s short-lived MSNBC show “Disrupt.” During her television career, Finney was famous for pulling no punches and partisan attacks. Finney once referred to “crazy crackers on the right” who opposed a comprehensive immigration bill and another time likened Republicans to the defenders of Apartheid. Clinton, who has reportedly selected a campaign headquarters, is expected to make her candidacy official in the next week or two.\n[The Finney hire, first reported by CNN and confirmed to Fox News, is paired with that of Oren Shur, who managed Gov. Jay Nixon’s, D-Mo., 2012 campaign, to head up Clinton’s television, mail, radio and digital advertising efforts.]\nGary Hart lacerates Hillary: ‘We need new leaders’ - The prospect of a billion-dollar Clinton campaign “ought to frighten every American,” former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart told Politico. Hart, who has been the recent beneficiary of some historical revisionism about his disastrous 1988 presidential run, says his party needs a competitive primary challenge to force Hillary to get “specific” on issues. Hart adds he likes the Democratic frontrunner, “but we need new leaders.”\nO’Malley, Webb head for Hawkeye State - A pair of potential Hillary challengers are headed for Iowa later this week. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb will be in the first-in-the-nation caucus state for multi-day trips starting Thursday. O’Malley’s two-day swing begins in Indianola and Des Moines and is his first sojourn to Iowa since he ramped-up criticism of an inevitable Clinton coronation. Webb will spend four days in the Hawkeye State. Both potential contenders will speak at an awards dinner put on by Polk County Democrats on Friday.\n2016 Democratic Power Index - 1) Hillary Clinton; 2) Martin O’Malley; 3) Joe Biden; 4) Jim Webb [+1]; 5) Elizabeth Warren [-1]\n2016 SENATE POLLS: PORTMAN DOWN, TOOMEY UP, FLA. WIDE OPEN\nA new Quinnipiac University swing state poll of 2016 Senate contests released today shows Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio trailing lead Democrat, former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland by 9 points. Helped by independent voters, Strickland leads 49 percent to Portman’s 29 percent.  The incumbent Republican In Pennsylvania, Sen. Pat Toomey, leads Democratic challenger Joe Sestak 48 - 35 percent, according to the survey. In Florida, where Sen. Marco Rubio expected to make his 2016 presidential intentions known next week, the contest looks wide open if he passes on re-election. Republican State Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater is the strongest candidate, getting 38 percent to 34 percent for Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Fla. Atwater leads another possible Democratic candidate, Rep. Alan Grayson, 42 - 32 percent. In other possible matchups sans Rubio, Murphy gets 35 percent to 31 percent for GOP Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera and Lopez-Cantera gets 33 percent to 32 percent for Grayson.\nHIS DIGNITY WAS OFFENDED, NO DOUBT\nA Tampa Bay-area man says he feels he is being discriminated against because a local movie theater will not allow him to bring in his Cookie Monster-emblazoned messenger bag while women are allowed to bring in purses. Zac Adams told Bay News 9, “I feel discriminated against, because…the only reason that they stopped me was because I was a guy with a bag.”  Adams filmed the exchange with a theater staffer told him, “ladies carry big bags, that’s the normal thing for ladies to do.” When Adams asked the staffer if he were a lady would he be allowed in, the manager replied, “yes.”  The theater’s manager went on to say, “You could be holding onto recording devices, but ladies, it’s normal for them. Every lady carries a purse. Not every man carries a purse.” Indignant, Adams defended his “Sesame Street” accessory: “It’s not a purse, it’s a bag. I have my glasses in there, my credit card.” According to Adams, he takes the bag everywhere and that it contains, “just general accessories any guy would have.”\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.  Want FOX News First in your inbox every day?

It’s is a way to control your smartphone with the tap of a finger.\nBen Harris, co-founder of Easier to Use, which developed the GoGlove, said the idea came to him while he was out on the slopes with some friends. The time it took to take his phone out of his pocket, take off his gloves, change the song or adjust the volume, and then put everything back, put him way behind the rest of the group, who he said were already to the bottom of the hill. Harris knew he wanted to come up with an easier way to use his phone without needing to touch the screen.\n\"We're finding people love being able to control their phone remotely. They’re leaving their phone in their pocket or purse and are really able to have the same control of their phone as if it were in their hand,” he said.\nThe GoGlove is designed to allow people running, biking, walking or hitting the slopes to use their music, camera, GoPro, or listen to texts by tapping their fingers rather than taking the phone out and manually using it.\n“Whatever your phone can do, you can control with GoGlove,” said Harris.\nA Bluetooth module in the glove is connected to sensors in the fingertips, according to GoGlove Designer Eric Ely. Each sensor controls different functions on the phone when it’s tapped.\n\"It’s all based on the magnet in your thumb and the sensor on your finger tip,\" he said. \"You just tap the magnet to the individual finger… as well as one at the base of your index finger.\"\nEly said that GoGlove’s main purpose is to give users more control over their devices. By connecting the gloves to the GoGlove app, the user can set the function that each finger controls.\n“It's a great concept when you’re flying down the mountain and a good song comes on and you kind of get in that moment and that makes everything better,\" he explained. \"Really we are just trying to make that experience easier to control.” \nThe gloves are meant to be lightweight so they can fit inside thicker gloves in the winter. Harris said that, in testing, bigger gloves haven’t interfered with the magnets. Ely said that the GoGlove was also designed to be easily hand washed and with an active user in mind. He said the material is resistant to sweat and light moisture.  \nHarris added that the GoGlove’s Bluetooth module can be removed from the glove and used in warmer weather. The module can be clipped onto a shirt or bike and can still control the smartphone.\nGoGlove is on Kickstarter where Harris and his team are trying to get funding to take the gloves into production.

But we're farming out the inspections to U.N. officials. Once those sanctions are lifted, you're going to have companies in Asia and Europe going in to cut deals with Iran. And then there will be tremendous pressure to keep those deals in place, snap-back provisions or no snap-back provisions, because there will be an economic interest from those countries to keep that business going.","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/05/sen-corker-reacts-to-iran-deal-catholic-church-addresses-persecution-christians/ "},{"property1":"So, once we lift these sanctions, I think it will be very hard to get back to where we are now.

And we're back now with the panel. Jason, what is your take away from the retreat, if you will, that -- first of all, about the whole debate over religious freedom and the fact that the governors, as you saw here of Arkansas and Indiana after first saying they were going to sign these bills then had to insist that they be reworked before they did -- were finished with them.","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/05/sen-corker-reacts-to-iran-deal-catholic-church-addresses-persecution-christians/ "},{"property1":"JASON RILEY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Well, both sides are claiming intolerance here. But I think only one side is really guilty of hypocrisy. And that's what I see going on here. Hillary Clinton who opposed gay marriage until two years ago is tweeting about Indiana's intolerance. The Democratic governor of Connecticut who banned state employees from traveling to Indiana even though Connecticut has essentially the same law in place. So that's what I think is going on here. It is the height of hypocrisy, positions held just a few years ago by Democrats are now considered anti-gay and bigotry in place.","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/05/sen-corker-reacts-to-iran-deal-catholic-church-addresses-persecution-christians/ "},{"property1":"WALLACE: Juan, let me pick up on that because the initial push was that these laws and the people who supported them were being intolerant, the idea that a private business could discriminate, let's say, against participants in a gay marriage, that that was intolerant, but you began to hear a push back later, especially this week, that to insist that someone do something that violates their moral conviction, that that's intolerant. How do you balance those two?","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/05/sen-corker-reacts-to-iran-deal-catholic-church-addresses-persecution-christians/ "},{"property1":"WILLIAMS: I think it's very hard to balance because, you know, someone who has religious beliefs myself, I want them to be respected. But I do think we're a nation of laws. And we are not a nation of religious beliefs. Everyone in our country can have their religious beliefs, but you have to come back to civil laws and liberties. And as such, I don't think there's any question that if the law specifies that you are open for business, whether it's gays or blacks, that under our laws, public accommodation laws, et cetera, that you have to treat people equally and fairly. That's the basis of our understanding.","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/05/sen-corker-reacts-to-iran-deal-catholic-church-addresses-persecution-christians/ "},{"property1":"Now, I will say in response to Jason, there's been a tremendous shift in the terms of American public opinion, and that's why I think you see people who two years ago may have had one position, I think President Obama says he's evolved on this issue, I think much of America has evolved and changed on this issue and that's why you see corporate America taking the lead in this fight, by the way.","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/05/sen-corker-reacts-to-iran-deal-catholic-church-addresses-persecution-christians/ "},{"property1":"WALLACE: Jason, let me just pick up on this conversation between the two of you. I think it would certainly agree that if somebody came in to the baker, you know, the proverbial baker's getting a lot of business as baker, that and said, you know, an interracial marriage and we want a cake. I think you would say that that's outrageous the idea that he would not participate in an interracial marriage. Why is that any different than the same sex marriage?","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/05/sen-corker-reacts-to-iran-deal-catholic-church-addresses-persecution-christians/ "},{"property1":"RILEY: We have antidiscrimination laws in the book, we have public accommodation laws in the book and there's no indication that there's any pattern of courts allowing these laws, these religious freedom laws to trump those laws. I think this is a straw man. This is being gemmed up. And there's no reason we can't handle them on a case by case basis like we've been doing. But I do agree with Juan that there's an evolution in the country particularly among young people. Which is why you see some division, even on the right about how to proceed with these cultural wars, so to speak. This is very much a generational issue. And with the GOP out there looking at the next presidential election, wanting to appeal to younger voters, there's some indication that, you know, we've got other issues to talk about. Hilary is deleting e-mails. Obama is cutting deals with (INAUDIBLE) over nuclear weapons. Let's talk about those things, those unite the party. They don't want to talk about it.","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/05/sen-corker-reacts-to-iran-deal-catholic-church-addresses-persecution-christians/ "},{"property1":"WILLIAMS: And I just quickly say before we let our friends in that, in fact in Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court said that in some cases where you have a family-owned business with strong religious beliefs that you can take into consideration their faith with regard to providing contraception to women. And what we've seen in Indiana is different than Connecticut and these other states, because they would say it's not just a matter of government having to have a high bar in terms of putting any pressure on a religious belief, but individuals and corporations could now go to court and say we're protected by the same kind of provisions.","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/05/sen-corker-reacts-to-iran-deal-catholic-church-addresses-persecution-christians/ "},{"property1":"WALLACE: We could continue this conversation and I'm sure we will, but let's turn to the economy and some really disappointing numbers on the economy this week. Here they are. Only 126,000 jobs were added in March. That's the weakest hiring in 15 months. Labor force participation dropped to 62.7 percent, matching the lowest since 1978. And the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta estimates first quarter growth at zero, zero percent, flat. George, what's going on here?","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/05/sen-corker-reacts-to-iran-deal-catholic-church-addresses-persecution-christians/ "},{"property1":"GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, for the second year in a row they've blamed poor quarterly growth on insufficient global warming, that is on winter, on an unusually cold winter. Let your mind go back to November last year. There was job creation of 321,000 jobs and the administration said this is a miraculous achievement and a harbinger of things to come. It wasn't a harbinger and it wasn't miraculous. During the Reagan recovery there were 23 months of job creation over 300,000. Reagan had a month of job creation of 1 million and this was at a time when there were 75 million fewer Americans. Now, never mind zero growth. We are now being told really that two percent growth may be the new normal. If so, that's a disaster because every day, today, yesterday, tomorrow, every day between now and 2030, 10,000 more baby boomers become eligible for Social Security and Medicare. If we have two percent growth, the crisis of the welfare state, the crisis of the private sector being able to throw off the revenues, to pay the bills for the promises we've made to ourselves becomes impossible.","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/05/sen-corker-reacts-to-iran-deal-catholic-church-addresses-persecution-christians/ "},{"property1":"WALLACE: Just tell again that the labor force participation stat that you have, if it were what it was at the beginning of the Obama administration.","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/05/sen-corker-reacts-to-iran-deal-catholic-church-addresses-persecution-christians/ "},{"property1":"WILL: If the workforce participation rate today were as high as it was on the day Barack Obama was inaugurated, the unemployment rate in this country would be 9.7 percent, we wouldn't be complaining about the bad recovery because we wouldn't call it a recovery.","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/05/sen-corker-reacts-to-iran-deal-catholic-church-addresses-persecution-christians/ "},{"property1":"WALLACE: All right, let's talk about the bad recovery, Mara. How concerned are they at the White House with those latest jobs numbers? Do they think it's more? Because one of the things I was talking about, was we really had bad weather in the northeast in March and what do they think it says about the recovery?","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/05/sen-corker-reacts-to-iran-deal-catholic-church-addresses-persecution-christians/ "},{"property1":"MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Well, I think they are concerned. And it says the recovery can't seem to get any lift off and stay there. I mean, one of the big things that Barack Obama said in the State of the Union address is it's time to turn the page. The recovery is growing. Unemployment is down. Deficit is down. Now it's time to talk about other things. How to get growth more broadly shared, inequality, all sorts of things like that. We don't even have growth now. I think this does shift the big economic debate in the country back to just getting growth. Because you can't talk about it being more widely shared if you don't have it.","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/05/sen-corker-reacts-to-iran-deal-catholic-church-addresses-persecution-christians/ "},{"property1":"WALLACE: But you've got to think with the divisions between the Republican Congress and the White House is nothing that they -- the president talks about job stimulus, things like that, nothing he proposes is going to get ...","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/05/sen-corker-reacts-to-iran-deal-catholic-church-addresses-persecution-christians/ "},{"property1":"LIASSON: No, absolutely not.

I do think what they were hoping to do was at least lay the table for 2016, get the kind of themes and frame the debate the way he wanted to, not necessarily pass things through Congress, with the exception of a few little things like trade, maybe, maybe some corporate tax reform.","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/05/sen-corker-reacts-to-iran-deal-catholic-church-addresses-persecution-christians/ "},{"property1":"WILLIAMS: That's what I was going to say. I think it's even worse than that. Because I think your Congress is talking about sequestration. They cannot pass the kind of infrastructure support the highway trust fund bill. So, essentially Congress is not contributing to this. And I would add that there are lots of people, George, in our society that over time are reaching that baby boomer age you're referring to, and I think that's part of the labor force participation equation.","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/05/sen-corker-reacts-to-iran-deal-catholic-church-addresses-persecution-christians/ "},{"property1":"RILEY: I think this president is perfectly happy with this supposed new normal. I mean this is someone who looks at the social welfare states of Europe, with their higher unemployment rates and lower productivity than we have here, and sees them not as cautionary tales, but as models for us to emulate. He wants more entitlements. He is willing to trade for that lower productivity, less labor participation rate for this cradle to grave entitlements and so forth. More social spending.

The Washington D.C. City Council recently passed a measure that says \"religious institutions can't discriminate in hiring someone who doesn't follow your teachings on birth control and abortion.\" And another measure that says \"religious affiliated schools must treat gay groups like any other.\" How do you balance religious freedom versus gay and reproductive rights?","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/05/sen-corker-reacts-to-iran-deal-catholic-church-addresses-persecution-christians/ "},{"property1":"WUERL: I think what we want to do is make sure we're using the same measuring rod for everybody. If we talk about discrimination, then we also have to talk about discriminating against the Catholic Church, its teachings and its ability to carry out its mission. I think at the heart of this is the ability to recognize everyone. Everyone has the dignity of who they are. But how they act now touches others. And no one should be forced to follow the actions of another and accept the actions of another. Our schools should be free to teach. We don't believe in abortion. And we need to be free to teach that.","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/05/sen-corker-reacts-to-iran-deal-catholic-church-addresses-persecution-christians/ "},{"property1":"WALLACE: So, let's take the classic case that we're hearing about this week, the Christian baker who is being asked to make a cake for a gay wedding and doesn't want to do it.

Is it being used in the same way for both instances? I wonder if across the board we're not seeing different measuring rods being used when it comes to issues that we're facing here, for example. Why would it be discrimination for a catholic university to say we're not going to allow a gay rights or an abortion rights group to have their program on our campus? And it not be discrimination for that group to insist that the catholic school change its teaching? If we use the same measure, I think we'll find a way of lowering the decimal level and finding a way to recognize the dignity of everyone and at the same time recognize the freedom and the rights, especially religious liberty of everyone.","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/05/sen-corker-reacts-to-iran-deal-catholic-church-addresses-persecution-christians/ "},{"property1":"WALLACE: Let me switch to another very difficult subject this Easter weekend. Christians are being hit across the Middle East and in Africa. In Kenya, the al Shabaab terror group killed 147 targeting Christians. In Libya, ISIS beheaded 21 Egyptian Christians. In Syria, they kidnapped 200 Assyrian Christians.","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/05/sen-corker-reacts-to-iran-deal-catholic-church-addresses-persecution-christians/ "},{"property1":"Cardinal, ISIS talks about conquering Rome, their phrase.

When you look at all of these incidences, I think they're all directed at Christians. What just happened in Kenya, I'm told what I heard on the media was that those assassins went in and they separated the Christians from the Muslims and killed the Christians. This is something that the whole world should be shouting out about, the whole world should be rejecting this.","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/05/sen-corker-reacts-to-iran-deal-catholic-church-addresses-persecution-christians/ "},{"property1":"WALLACE: But you know, shouting out and rejecting isn't enough. And I want to ask you about that because Pope Francis says that it is, quote, \"lawful to stop an unjust aggressor. So, what do you do in the case of ISIS? Is it moral to use force? Is it a just war to stop ISIS?","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/05/sen-corker-reacts-to-iran-deal-catholic-church-addresses-persecution-christians/ "},{"property1":"WUERL: What the Holy Father said I think is absolutely true. It's also common sense. Everybody knows that you can defend yourself against an aggressor. All you have to do is try even with a child to smack the child. The child's hand is going to go up to protect itself. Why? It's instinctive in us to stay alive. And so everyone has a right to defend their life. What's happening with ISIS, what's happening with this idea of a caliphate, is simply taking intolerance and hatred and violence to a new institutional level. And, yes, everyone has a right to defend themselves.

God loves all of us the way we are. God forgives us. And God asks us to love one another. The great commandment love God and love your neighbor is echoed over and over and over again in the teaching of Pope Francis. But I think what people see and why they're so attracted to him -- and I'm told he has the highest popularity rating of anyone -- I think one of the reasons for that, Chris, is we see in him not just the message, but how you do it. The way in which he lives, treats people, responds to people, says I think to many people says to me, he sounds and looks a lot like what Jesus would have sounded like.","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/05/sen-corker-reacts-to-iran-deal-catholic-church-addresses-persecution-christians/ "},{"property1":"WALLACE: There are, on the other hand, some church practices that some American Catholics are not happy with.

The teaching, which never changes, and how we live that teaching, how we apply that teaching and how we try to make the best of the situation in which we find ourselves. He keeps saying, and this is a beautiful part of his ministry, he keeps saying, go out, meet people where they are, and accompany them on their journey so that perhaps all of us could get a little closer to where we all need to be. And I think that's the beauty of his ministry. I also think that's the secret to why so many people find him so inviting, so welcoming. He's saying you can, you can do better.

If everything that we've heard about it is true, basically what we're doing is what the U.S. is agreeing to is to lock in the nuclear infrastructure in Iran, so that they can break loose; they can break out. We're allowing them to keep the uranium, the centrifuges. They're going to have the -- as I understand it, they're going to have the encased locations, which will make it very difficult for us to take them out in the future.","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/06/rep-king-talks-long-term-us-outlook-for-dealing-with-iran-mlb-commissioner/"},{"property1":"So this, to me, is -- you know, we went into this to take away Iran's nuclear power.

I mean, a lot of other things should be a deal-breaker. That should -- that should certainly be a deal breaker. And yet -- I just think this administration and I think the president obviously wants a deal, and he's willing to take a not-so-good deal, because I believe that he wants to, in fact, institutionalize Iran, to make Iran a dominant player in the Middle East so you have the U.S. and Iran almost a balance of power and, I think, almost like maybe in the days of the U.S. and the Soviet Union.","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/06/rep-king-talks-long-term-us-outlook-for-dealing-with-iran-mlb-commissioner/"},{"property1":"Because more and more people I've spoken to both in the administration and in Washington believe the president wants to end the days of us feuding with Iran, and he believes, if Iran is given its leeway, that they will join the community of nations.","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/06/rep-king-talks-long-term-us-outlook-for-dealing-with-iran-mlb-commissioner/"},{"property1":"BARTIROMO: It really is quite extraordinary.

So when ISIS came in, the army was no equipped to take them on.

They are directional, which is about all you could frankly expect at this time.","url":"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/06/rep-king-talks-long-term-us-outlook-for-dealing-with-iran-mlb-commissioner/"},{"property1":"By June, they all expect to have a written agreement, something that is enforceable, something that has much more teeth to it.
