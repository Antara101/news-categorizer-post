    "ARVIN, California \u2013 Californians who grumble about not being able to water their lawns everyday during the fourth year of a historic drought should swing by this small town in southern Kern County.Drought or no drought, residents of this rural community can\u2019t drink water from the tap and can\u2019t even use it for cooking because high levels of arsenic \u2014 known to cause cancer \u2014 become even more concentrated when water is boiled.\u201cThey worry about little things,\u201d said Salvador Partida, president of the Committee for a Better Arvin, of the rest of the state. \u201cWe\u2019re worried about not being able to drink the water.\u201dLast week Gov. Jerry Brown ordered the State Water Resources Control Board to enact mandatory cuts in water use by 25 percent. But more than 1 million California residents who live in mostly rural areas have unreliable access to safe drinking water, according to the Community Water Center, a non-profit group that advocates affordable and clean water for all Californians. For them, the ongoing drought that is ravaging the state's water supply is merely a sideshow.Tap water that comes mostly from wells in these communities violated maximum contaminant level standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency at least once in 2012 \u2013 the most recent annual compliance report by\u00a0\u00a0the state\u2019s drinking water program.The number of violations with potential direct public health impact may affect even more people because of insufficient regulation and under-reporting, especially in areas served by small systems, said Heather Lukacs, project director at the Community Water Center.More than 100 areas with fewer than 10,000 people had arsenic violations. Most are small, poor communities with a predominantly Hispanic population, some of whom are forced to spend up to 10 percent of household income on bottled water.As of February of this year, the state reports that approximately 255,000 people served by 341 systems got water that was not potable. Almost half of the residents affected were getting water that exceeded the acceptable level of arsenic. The number is expected to rise over the entire year as more violations are reported.\u201cA lot of it is aged infrastructure,\u201d said Sarah Buck, rural development specialist with the Rural Community Assistance Corporation. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very expensive to drill additional wells.\u201dThere is now a statewide effort to bring safe drinking water to all Californians. The\u00a0Agua4All campaign, a coalition of state and advocacy groups, including The California Endowment, has just launched pilot programs here and in nearby Lamont and the Coachella Valley to bring water fountains and water bottle filling stations to schools, parks and community centers.The plan is to place Agua4All stations in all parts of the state that need them.In 2012, the groups \u2014 all members of the Safe Water Alliance \u2014 sponsored The Human Right to Water Bill, which was signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown. California became the first state to legally recognize that every human being has the right to safe, clean, affordable and accessible water adequate for human consumption, cooking and sanitary purposes.The bill helped launch the current effort to provide \u201cpoint-of-use water treatment systems\u201d that remove arsenic from the water at drinking fountains in poor communities. A state grant of more than $400,000 is helping provide up to 69 filters to install on new Agua4All water fountains and continued maintenance. This is the first time the State Water Board has funded such a large number of treatment systems at water stations.\u201cEverybody knows the water can\u2019t be drunk because it stinks,\u201d Partida said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to drink that and I\u2019m certainly not going to let my kids drink that.\u201dPartida and his wife spend $4 to $5 a week for two 5-gallon jugs of clean water.\u201cSo you can imagine if you\u2019ve got a lot of kids,\u201d he said. \u201cNinety-nine percent of the population in Arvin buys bottled water \u2026 I\u2019m amazed nobody was doing anything about it until now. A lot of people need to wake up.\u201dIn Arvin, a city of about 20,000, 93 percent of the population is Hispanic, according to the Census Bureau. In nearby Lamont, an unincorporated area of 15,000 people, 95 percent are Hispanic.\u201cArsenic has been in certain parts of the aquifer at least for decades,\u201d said Lukacs, with the Community Water Center, an Agua4All partner that\u2019s working with affected communities. \u201cHere, it\u2019s mostly naturally occurring, and for that reason, we need to ensure people have access to safe water.\u201dArvin Councilman Jose Gurrola, Jr. is a staunch supporter of long-term solutions to the city\u2019s water problem.\u201cWe\u2019re drilling new wells that have no arsenic,\u201d he said, keeping his fingers crossed.That\u2019s because when two wells are drilled in the next two years, they may or may not produce arsenic-free water. Preliminary tests show a good chance of finding safe water but the city won\u2019t know until the drilling is done. The cost, originally at $4.5 million, has risen to $5.5 million because the drilling frenzy by big agricultural interests throughout the Central Valley has raised demand.If the wells are clean, three more will be drilled at a cost of $9.7 million. If they\u2019re not, the city will have to build two centralized arsenic treatment plants. Total additional cost: $18.7 million.The money would have to come from the state and federal governments, taxpayers and grants but there are no guarantees. Plus, the burden of paying for expensive maintenance and loan repayments could fall on local residents.In Lamont Park, three green fountains have been installed. Residents can drink from them and fill water bottles to take home.\u201cFor low-income families, buying clean water is a big burden,\u201d said Gerardo Tinaco, an Arvin native who works for the Community Water Center. \u201cThey pay for their water bill and then they pay for 5-gallon jugs.\u201dThe Agua4All campaign is combining its efforts to bring potable water to poor communities with the Building Healthy Communities effort funded by The California Endowment. A 2011 survey by the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research showed that 73 percent of children in the Arvin-Lamont area drank soda or sugar-sweetened beverages the day before the survey was taken.Chris Molina, director of operations at the Boys and Girls Clubs of Kern County, stands by one of the new filtered water stations in the Lamont facility. \u201cIt\u2019s been great for the kids,\u201d he said. \u201cThey used to drink sodas. Now they\u2019re drinking more water.\u201dAnother water station is planned in front of the club, right across a major drop-off point for school buses that carry up to 400 high school students.Ivan Chetala and Karla Hernandez are lounging on the grass at Lamont Park with 7-month-old Carol in a stroller. The Lamont residents said they buy five gallons of water every week but continue to cook with tap water.Tinaco tells them in Spanish about the new water fountain nearby and advises them to fill up water bottles from there. He also warns them that boiling the water will not help with the arsenic problem. \u201cIt seems so simple,\u201d Molina said. \u201cOne little fountain and now we see kids drinking the water and say it tastes better and parents don\u2019t have to purchase water for them.\u201d",

    "\u201cLocal folks don\u2019t want to talk \u2014 especially to us white folks,\u201d the manager of Evergreen told me.This was 12 years ago, while I was touring the large plantation as it was undergoing renovation along the famous Plantation Alley between the southern cities of Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Louisiana. Evergreen\u2019s rows of cabins are one of the few intact slave quarters remaining in the United States.My question had been, \u201cWho lived here? Surely there must be local families who grew up around or near here?\u201d I wondered whether local African-Americans who still worked some of the active sugarcane fields would have artifacts and family stories about slavery to share with curious visitors like me.But the old wounds of slavery and Jim Crow segregation ran wide and deep like the nearby Mississippi River. Tongues tied by decades of racial discord, local folks still didn\u2019t want to talk.In this landscape of stately restored plantation homes, swathes of sugarcane fields lining the highways, oil refineries belching toxins into the air, water and ground and roughly 16 percent of the population living below the poverty line, how should the history of slavery be told? The recent opening of a slavery museum in Louisiana reminds us that memorializing the enslaved is not enough. It\u2019s by illuminating architectures of violence that we can best speak truth to the brutal and dehumanizing conditions of slavery and its legacy in today\u2019s rising inequalities.To rebuild the history of slavery on the Whitney plantation, Cummings spent millions refurbishing it. He also moved slave cabins and outbuildings from other plantations onto the property to restore the full array of functions that had sustained its operations. The recreation of a working plantation is a unique effort to thrust the hidden and often unspoken activities that transpired in back of the big house into the spotlight of the tourists\u2019 gaze. Rather than witness how wealthy Southerners lived among their sumptuous furnishings, visitors walk through the spaces in which the plantation\u2019s enslaved workforce toiled to make that life of ease possible. Comparing the bare-floored slave cabin crowded with two families to the multi-bedroomed mansion becomes a lesson about how racial oppression produced stark inequalities.While it appears to be taking an important step to fill in the gaps in the histories of these plantations, the Whitney\u2019s memorial strategy might still fall short, particularly in how they have chosen to remember the enslaved.On the more successful side is the \u201cWall of Monuments,\u201d whose plaques identify first names of enslaved men, women and children listed in the plantation\u2019s ledgers, following a tradition of naming the dead starting with World War I memorials throughout the United States and Europe and utilized most famously in artist Maya Lin\u2019s sublime gray stone Vietnam Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.The Whitney is not the first plantation to highlight African-American slave history in the region. The River Road African-American Museum opened in 1994 at its initial location on the Tezcuco Plantation before it moved to its current site in Donaldsonville, Louisiana, a town founded by free people of color in 1806. Organized by black Americans \u2014 siblings from the Hambrick family who grew up in nearby Gonzales \u2014 it was among the first to recognize that white-owned plantations had historically neglected the African and African-American legacy on this soil and sought to rectify that oversight.But River Road currently faces financial shortfalls and does not yet have a permanent home for its growing collection of artifacts and artworks from rural families in plantation country. The challenge for African-Americans has always been that white Americans have controlled much of the land in the U.S. and thus American architectural heritage, history and preservation reflect those mainstream values.Against this backdrop, it becomes all the more important that visitors to the Whitney and other such museums \u2014 beyond an appreciation of historic vistas \u2014 must also comprehend the legacy of slavery in the modern-day economic, social and political inequalities that make Louisiana\u2019s African-American communities some of the poorest in the nation. Perhaps more open dialogues such as those initiated by the Whitney and River Road \u2014 along with the Smithsonian National African American Museum of History and Culture set to open soon in Washington D.C. \u2014 about this underrepresented chapter in American heritage will prompt locals in the parishes to tell their stories and share their histories.",
    "Four decades after Richard Nixon declared drugs\u00a0\u201cpublic enemy No. 1 in the United States,\u201d\u00a0the tide has turned on marijuana legalization. States are racing to follow Colorado and Washington in ending prohibition, and national politicians are scrambling to get out of the way.In the Senate, big names from both parties support a bill \u2014 the Compassionate Access, Research Expansion and Respect States (CARERS) Act \u2014 that would move marijuana out of Schedule I, the designation for heroin and other drugs with \u201cno currently accepted medical use,\u201d and into Schedule II, a group of substances that doctors can prescribe under certain circumstances. And in an interview with Vice\u2019s Shane Smith, President Barack Obama tacitly confirmed that the federal government would now let individual states proceed at their own pace. Think of it as the gay marriage strategy for surviving social change while in national office: Stay agnostic and let the states take care of it.But marijuana legalization and marriage equality are more different than they first appear. For one thing, in its more prohibitionist days, the federal government already established its primacy over state drug laws. In the 2005 Supreme Court decision Gonzales v. Raich, a confusing 6-3 ruling (with Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, Clarence Thomas and William Rehnquist dissenting), the court ruled against a California medical marijuana patient whose use was legal under state law. The justices found that the commerce clause allows Congress to regulate the interstate drug market and that the only way to do that effectively is to regulate drug use within states.The Drug Enforcement Agency operates according to the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), not state law, and \u201cIt\u2019s legal within city limits!\u201d is not a defense the feds recognize. The Obama administration has said it will exercise discretion, but you can hardly count on the government not to enforce the law.Because the Constitution requires states to give \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d to legal proceedings in other states, same-sex couples could challenge their home state to recognize a marriage performed elsewhere. But there\u2019s no constitutional right to smoke and no obvious way for individuals to sue for their weed, even if it\u2019s medicinal and legal under a revised federal law. As public records, marriage licenses fall under the full faith and credit clause, but prescriptions do not. Oregon State Appeals Court Judge Ronald D. Thom confirmed as much in 2010, when he ruled against Joel Dennis Berringer, a California medical marijuana patient who thought his prescription would be recognized in Oregon, which also has a medical marijuana law. Thom ruled that Berringer\u2019s arrest for possession was legitimate, since California law could protect him only from California law enforcement. Cases like this one show that marijuana legalization has to come through legislation, not the courts.If the CARERS Act passes and marijuana is rescheduled, it would not allow use of the drug without a prescription. Cocaine and morphine are Schedule II drugs, and you could hardly call them legal under federal law. The bill is a half-step, but some states are taking two. The District of Columbia has legalized marijuana, even though Congress has thwarted its legitimate sale by refusing to collect any tax revenue from it. Maintaining marijuana regulation under the CSA keeps the national drug war churning while letting some states go with a wink and a nod to sovereignty that doesn\u2019t, legally speaking, exist. It\u2019s not so different from how police treat marijuana now, letting some people coast and cracking down on others.This raises another question of federal law: equal protection. The 14th Amendment provides for \u201cequal protection of the law\u201d to all citizens, and it\u2019s this provision that invalidated parochial state rules segregating schools and banning interracial marriage. The spirit of the amendment \u2014 ratified in the wake of the Civil War and a foundation of civil-rights-era legislation \u2014 is that states are not permitted to maintain their own race codes. When you map state marijuana laws against their black populations, there\u2019s a clear inversion. States where there are larger black minorities have been less likely to liberalize their marijuana laws, which fits with the generally racist character of the drug war. Where there are exceptions, it\u2019s not legalization but decriminalization, which gives the police discretion \u2014 never a recipe for equal protection. The way the law seems headed, federal and state governments will uphold a prohibition that criminalizes black citizens in an explicitly disproportionate manner.Constitutional law is above my pay grade, but the president has no such excuse. He must know this latest game plan is a cowardly abdication. Unlike gay marriage, the federal government has already decided to take the ball on marijuana: The Gonzales of Gonzales v. Raich was U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. It remains in the government\u2019s hands. If locking people up for a joint was a federal concern in 2005, then letting them go should be a federal concern in 2015. The Constitution should not be at the whim of political convenience. Equal protection is more than just the law; it\u2019s a national ideal, and caging someone in Georgia for a blunt while letting the packed bowl in Oregon slide is a violation of that spirit.",
    "Foreigners applying for residency or work permits in Russia will soon have to answer politicized questions about the\u00a0newly annexed Crimean Peninsula, if a stiffened language and history exam reported by local media Monday is approved.The exam, which is compulsory for all immigrants seeking work in Russia, would replace a version that took effect earlier this year. Like the current test, applicants will have to demonstrate proficiency in Russian language and score at least a 60 percent on questions ranging from law and civics to the identity of famed Russian figure skater Irina Rodnina, the three-time Olympic champion who is now a pro-Kremlin lawmaker.But according to questions from the new test published in Izvestia newspaper, Crimean history will now come into focus \u2014 specifically, the peninsula's historical ties to Russia. Immigrants will have to name the republic that \u201cwas joined to\u201d Russia in 2014, as well as answer the question: \u201cIn which century did Crimea join Russia under Catherine the Great?\u201d (answer: the 18th).No official explanation has been given for why Russia has decided to update the exam, which was first introduced in 2012 amid a widening crackdown on immigration. Al Jazeera America attempts to contact the Russian embassy in Washington, D.C., for comment were unsuccessful.But the timing of the new changes did not seem a coincidence. Last spring, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in apparent retaliation for a pro-Western uprising in Kiev. Russian President Vladimir Putin framed the move as a reclamation, noting that Crimea belonged to the Soviet Union until 1954. Under the watchful eyes of Russian soldiers who were occupying the peninsula at the time, Crimea's mainly Russian-speaking residents also voted in favor of rejoining Russia in a public referendum.Kiev and its Western backers, including the United States, declared the annexation a violation of international law. They also accuse Russia of arming and egging on the pro-Russian separatist movement in eastern Ukraine, which is\u00a0currently under a cease-fire\u00a0agreement. The faceoff has\u00a0revived Cold War rhetoric\u00a0from both sides, stoking Russian nationalism and sending Putin\u2019s popularity soaring.The new residency test fits with the Kremlin's far-reaching efforts to promote its narrative on the events in Ukraine.\u00a0Last year, the Education Ministry introduced a program called \"We are united\" that provides powerpoint presentations and lesson plans for school teachers which emphasize Crimea's historically Russian character.The program also\u00a0explains that Putin acted\u00a0amid the \u201cincreasing political instability and criminalization of the situation\u201d in Ukraine, which led Crimea to hold a referendum \"in full compliance with democratic procedures and rules of international law,\" according to the Education Ministry's website.\u201cThe Russian government very much wants its own people\u00a0to know its preferred version of history\u00a0and now it seems they want foreigners to know it, too,\u201d said Derek Bloom, a U.S. lawyer who has been living and practicing law in Russia for two decades.But Bloom, a partner in the Moscow law office of Marks and Sokolov, said the changes seemed incremental. He also noted that Russia's requirements for residency are not entirely dissimilar to those in countries like the U.S. Bloom, who gained residency in Russia before the new test was introduced, is married to a Russian woman, who has gone through the U.S. version of the process.In these types of test, he said, \u201ccertainly there\u2019s a desire to bring up certain facts from the past\u201d and not others.About 440,000 migrants have taken the residency or work permit versions of the current test since it was launched this year, with 95 percent passing, Izvestia reported. According to the latest government statistics, however, Russia has seen a net exodus of migrant labor this year due to the sinking ruble \u2014 a result both of plummeting oil prices and Western sanctions imposed over Russia's actions in Ukraine.",
    "Craig Stephen Hicks, charged with first-degree murder in the\u00a0killing of three Muslim college students may face a death penalty trial, Superior Court Judge Orlando Hudson Jr.\u00a0ruled Monday.Hudson said that prosecutors had two aggravating factors and that Hicks is \"death penalty qualified.\"Hicks is charged with\u00a0three counts of first-degree murder\u00a0in the Feb. 10 killings of 23-year-old Deah Shaddy Barakat; his wife, 21-year-old Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha; and her sister, 19-year-old Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha.Prosecutors said that Hicks confessed; that he was arrested with the murder weapon, a handgun that ballistics experts matched to shell casings recovered at the apartment; that there was gunshot residue on his hands; and that blood from one of the victims was on his pants.Police say Hicks, 46, appears to have been motivated by a long-running dispute over parking spaces at the Chapel Hill, North Carolina, condominium complex where he lived in the same building as Barakat and Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha.The victims' families are adamant that they were targeted because they were Muslims and have pushed for hate-crime charges. The FBI is conducting what it has called a \"parallel preliminary inquiry\" to the homicide investigation to determine whether any federal laws were violated, including hate crime statutes.Search warrants filed by Chapel Hill police said Barakat was shot in the head near the entrance to his condo. The two women were found in or near the kitchen. Eight spent shell casings were found at the crime scene, investigators said.Earlier search warrants listed a dozen firearms recovered from the condo unit Hicks shared with his wife, in addition to the handgun he had with him when he turned himself in after the shootings.Hicks, who was unemployed and studying to become a paralegal, posted online that he is an atheist and a staunch advocate of the Second Amendment right to bear arms.Neighbors described him as an angry man who had frequent confrontations with other building residents over parking or loud music, sometimes with a gun holstered at his hip. He often discussed firearms in his social media posts, one of which included a photo of a .38-caliber revolver.The Associated Press",
    "New York City is in the midst of a homelessness crisis unprecedented in any American city. In just a decade, the number of people living in the city\u2019s homeless shelters has almost doubled.

    "According to the National Citizen Femicide Observatory, a coalition of 43 groups that document the crime, six women are assassinated every day.Yet only 24 percent of the 3,892 femicides the group identified in 2012 and 2013 were investigated by authorities. And only 1.6 percent led to sentencing.\u201cFemicides are a pandemic in Mexico,\u201d asserts Ana G\u00fcezmes, the local representative of United Nations Women, the agency devoted to gender issues.The word \"feminicidio\" first entered the vernacular in the 1990s, with explosive rates of disappearances and murders of women in the border town of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. In fact, more women have been killed in the state of Mexico, which surrounds the capital city of the same name. The number doubled from 2005 to 2011, when the current national president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, was governor of the state. Today he has pledged to combat drug violence overall but has not spoken out against femicides.Impunity is the main motor of the gender crime, G\u00fcezmes says, as well as social norms that allow the violence to be ignored or accepted as a normal part of life. She describes femicides as the extreme end of a society where 63 percent of women have suffered abuse by male hands. She estimates that maybe a third or half of the cases involved sexual partners. The balance \u2014 abductions, rapes and \u00a0discarding the bodies like garbage \u2014 are probably linked to the generalized drug violence that is tearing Mexico apart.G\u00fcezmes says the government needs to put more effort toward prevention, and improve access to justice. \u201cThese are the biggest problems.\u201dTo counter the lack of reliable government statistics, the Observatory trawls through press clips and conducts interviews door-to-door in marginalized neighborhoods, like this one on the edge of the capital city, where cases normally take place.The group issues regular reports and provides pro bono lawyers to relatives seeking to prosecute killers. They also erect pink crosses at death scenes, but these rarely last more than a day before unidentified men take them down.Most of these cases get lost in Mexico\u2019s dysfunctional justice system, where police officers can\u2019t be bothered to probe, or claim it\u2019s the woman\u2019s fault, or can be bought off by criminal gangs, says Maria de la Luz Estrada, head of the group. When the murders are investigated, incompetence and failure to follow due process often allow murderers to escape punishment.Activists say the distinction of femicide in the law is important, because the sexual nature distinguishes the killings from ordinary homicide.\u201cHate is what marks these crimes. The bodies show 20 or 30 blows,\u201d de la Luz says. \u201cThey slice off breasts and faces and throw the fragments in the garbage. In a macho society like Mexico, authorities are always questioning what the women did. What was she wearing? Was she sexually active? This helps the impunity and lack of action.\u201dThe victims are generally vulnerable young women, impoverished single mothers or teens. Attackers frequently seize victims on empty streets as they leave school or work, force them into cars, and then rape and torture them and dispose of the bodies.Families in poor areas like this one generally lack the money or clout to seek legal action, says de la Luz. \u201cThe parents are scared to give photos and details to the police, because that can make them vulnerable to extortionists, who say, \u2018We have her,\u2019 when in fact they don\u2019t. Corrupt authorities often say, \u2018If you speak out, your case won\u2019t advance.\u2019\u201dSu\u00e1rez Padilla is one of the few parents who have pressed charges, but he has had to confront misogynist cops, who implied that his daughter was responsible for her own death because her cell phone contained 200 nude photos taken by the killer.He takes solace in the international pressure that convinced Mexican lawmakers in 2007 to approve new laws aimed at preventing violence against women. The law called for a data bank and gender violence alerts, to encourage national, state and local governments to catch perpetrators and prevent murders. Yet neither has been activated effectively.The special prosecutor for violent crimes against women, Nelly Montealegre Diaz, admits that no femicides were prosecuted in 2014. She blames impunity and corruption, but says the government is addressing the problem in a gradual overhaul of the legal system.Harder to combat, she says, is social acceptance of gender violence. \u201cIf a worker sees a [female] colleague with a black eye or the father hitting the mother, they think it is normal. Women are seen as objects.\u201d",
    "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Speaking to a packed crowd of supporters on Monday evening, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said he was still mulling entering the 2016 presidential contest, but would only do so if he thought he could \u201cput together millions of people who are prepared to work really hard to take on the big-money interests.\"Sanders has openly discussed his potential candidacy for months, and even paid\u00a0a visit to the crucial primary state of Iowa earlier this year. But in recent weeks he has\u00a0begun to sound more reluctant about jumping into the race, in large part because of doubts over whether he could raise the money necessary to run a credible campaign.\u00a0During Monday\u2019s speaking event, Sanders indicated that he was concerned a poor\u00a0showing would undermine political support for left-wing economic policies.\u201cIt has to be done well,\u201d the Senate\u2019s one self-identified democratic socialist said during a public event at San Francisco's Commonwealth Club, the oldest public-affairs forum in the United States. \u201cBecause if it\u2019s not done well, then people will say, \u2018Oh, income and wealth inequality: If you didn\u2019t do very well in your campaign, then no one believes in that.\u2019\"But if the senator is leaning against running, he gave no indication\u00a0on Monday. Instead he turned the question on the audience, asking how many people in the crowd wanted him to run for president and would be\u00a0willing to volunteer for his campaign if he did.\u201cAre people of the belief that we really cannot defeat these guys because they\u2019re so powerful?\u201d he asked, referring to the billionaires who he says he would be running to oppose. \u201cOr in fact is there enough hope left in America to bring out people together to fight for a different country?\"When people in the audience began to applaud\u00a0in response, he waved it off. \u201cNo, it was a question, not a comment,\u201d he said.The audience \u2014 mostly residents of one of the most liberal regions of the country \u2014 seemed overwhelmingly supportive of a presidential bid. When Sanders asked again near the end of the event how many people in the audience believe he should run for president, he received nearly unanimous applause.If doubts about his ability to raise money are\u00a0the main thing giving Sanders pause, then California\u2019s Bay Area is an ideal place to put those doubts to the test. The region is a hot spot for Democratic political fundraising. Hillary Clinton, the presumptive frontrunner in the Democratic primary, made a recent appearance in nearby Silicon Valley\u00a0and is expected to make a few more in April.Much of the rest of Sanders\u2019s appearance was\u00a0dedicated to his key policy themes: Rising inequality, stagnating wages, public investment, and\u00a0the people who he jokingly referred to as \u201cmy good friends on Wall Street.\"In response to one question about financial regulation, Sanders endorsed \u201ca fee on Wall Street speculation\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to the idea of a financial transaction tax \u2014\u00a0and urged government action to \u201cbreak up\u201d the large financial institutions that are considered \u201ctoo big to fail.\"\u201cNow having said that, David,\u201d he said, addressing moderator David Campos, a member of San Francisco\u2019s Board of Supervisors, \u201cdo you think I\u2019m going to get many campaign contributions?\"",
    "Lufthansa\u00a0said Monday it was not required to inform German aviation authorities about Andreas Lubitz's former depression, because he qualified as a pilot before stricter reporting rules went into effect in 2013.Lubitz, a co-pilot at Lufthansa's budget division Germanwings,\u00a0is believed to have deliberately crashed the plane into the French Alps\u00a0that killed 150 people.The question of what Lufthansa knew about any psychiatric problems may be a factor in its liability in the crash. Germany's Allianz estimates that insurers will end up paying $300 million in claims and costs related to the crash.Lubitz broke off pilot training for several months in 2009. When he resumed his training, he told the Lufthansa pilot instructors by email he had overcome a period of severe depression. He was first certified to fly commercial planes in 2012.Under European regulations, pilots with psychiatric conditions should be referred to the licensing authority by medical examiners, who may then decide to restrict the pilot\u2019s license.The Luftfahrtbundesamt (LBA), the relevant German authority, said on Sunday it had \"no information at all\" before the crash about Lubitz's depression.Lufthansa said that a provision in the new regulation, introduced in\u00a0Germany in April 2013, safeguarded certain pre-existing fit-to-fly certificates and medical certificates issued by specialized aviation doctors.Aviation medical centers or doctors could therefore issue extensions to such medical certificates even after the new rules came into effect, the airline said.\"A general and separate duty to refer to the LBA did not therefore arise as a result of the change in the legal position,\" Lufthansa said.Dirk Fischer, a senior member of parliament in Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, told the Rheinische Post newspaper last week that the confidentiality rules should be relaxed if the lives of others could be put in jeopardy.But medical and aviation associations rejected those calls, arguing the laws were a \"precious commodity\" that should not be tampered with.\"Such measures won't prevent accidents from happening in the future. Instead it will only lead to affected patients not seeking out treatment, so as to prevent information being passed on to their employer,\" the German Federation of Internists said last week.Doctors already have authority to break the confidentiality vows if they feel their patient puts others at risk, according to Frank Ulrich Montgomery, head of the Federal Chamber of Physicians in Germany.Privacy is fiercely guarded in\u00a0Germany, a reaction to the mass surveillance carried out by the Gestapo in the Nazi era and the Stasi in post-war communist East\u00a0Germany.Under German law, employers cannot access employees' medical records and sick notes excusing a person from work do not specify their medical condition.Pilots in\u00a0Germany\u00a0are required to inform examiners at their annual medical checks of any relevant health issues.In Britain, examiners at pilots' regular medical checks can request records from other doctors if they need them.In the United States, laws on whether mental health providers can report that a patient poses an immediate threat of harm to self or others vary by state.In states that require health professionals to disclose information about patients that pose a risk to others, the medical professional must inform law enforcement authorities.Reuters",

    "Conservative U.S. governors who came to power during the 2010 tea party electoral wave are facing a reality check. A few years ago, catering to a far-right constituency, they campaigned on pledges of slashing taxes and bolstering business. Their subsequent policies have benefited the wealthy but failed to bring trickle-down prosperity to their states.It is the morning after the tea party. Republican governors are waking up to a sluggish job market, stagnant wages, state deficits and impoverished services. The party\u2019s trickle-down ideology is no way to manage a government. And a state cannot be run on tax cuts alone.Recent headlines are much different than those in 2010: \u201cRepublican governors buck party line on raising taxes,\u201d read a recent headline in The New York Times. \u201cTax increases a much-regretted necessity for Republican governors,\u201d said another in Bloomberg. \u201cRepublican governors are flirting with tax hikes,\u201d the Christian Science Monitor noted.Conservative governors now recognize the need to generate revenue to maintain schools and highways. But they are still not taking responsibility and cleaning up the messes they have created. Rather than reversing tax cuts for the wealthy, many are implementing regressive measures that penalize middle-class taxpayers.\u201cOf the 10 or so Republican governors who have proposed tax increases, nearly all have called for increases in consumption taxes, which hit the poor and middle class harder than the rich,\u201d The New York Times reported last month. This includes new taxes on gas, e-cigarettes, movie tickets and services such as haircuts.In 2010, conservatives had a banner election year riding popular anger at Washington. In all, 11 Democratic governors lost to Republican victors. The GOP took control of both houses in 25 state legislatures.For the new tea-party-backed leaders, tax cuts were high on the agenda. Governors such as Michigan\u2019s Rick Snyder and Kansas\u2019 Sam Brownback explicitly said business executives \u2014 rechristened by Republican wordsmiths as \u201cjob creators\u201d \u2014 would see immediate benefits. Snyder pledged \u201cto eliminate the Michigan Business Tax and replace it with a 6 percent flat corporate income tax,\u201d according to The Grand Rapids Press, arguing it will result in \u201ca $1.5 billion tax cut on Michigan job creators.\u201d The night of his victory, Brownback flatly said he was opposed to \u201ctaxes on capital formation.\u201dWhat Brownback and Snyder, along with Ohio\u2019s John Kasich and Wisconsin\u2019s Scott Walker, were promoting in their states is merely the most recent incarnation of what George H.W. Bush once called \u201ca voodoo economic policy.\u201d Conservative logic has long held that tax cuts for the wealthy work miracles by stimulating economic activity. The argument goes: Not only do tax cuts create growth throughout the economy \u2014 thus boosting the fortunes of working people \u2014 but they also bolster state revenues and allow for balanced budgets, since people end up paying taxes on higher incomes.Debating the merits of this philosophy with then-Gov. Ronald Reagan in the 1980 Republican presidential primaries, Bush argued, \u201cIt just isn\u2019t gonna work.\u201d He was right. It didn\u2019t work then: Budget deficits soared during the Reagan years. As tea party governors are learning, it isn\u2019t working now either.In Kansas, Brownback lowered tax rates for top earners by 26 percent. Now the state faces a $334 million budget deficit. Kansas\u2019 public services are so emaciated that the State Supreme Court ruled the funding of the school system unconstitutional. Economic growth has stalled and the state\u2019s employment growth currently ranks 34th in the nation.\u201cBrownback\u2019s recent promise of 100,000 new private sector jobs in his next four years\u00a0seems to be unrealistic,\u201d Kansas City Star columnist Yael T. Abouhalkah, wrote in January. \u201cThat\u2019s because the state would need to create 2,100 jobs a month while it\u2019s been averaging close to 1,300 a month for his first four years in office.\u201dWisconsin is experiencing similar woes from supply-side tax cuts and union busting. In 2013 the Federal Reserve ranked Wisconsin 49th in economic outlook and 44th in private-sector job growth. Wages fell 2.2 percent that year. Wisconsin is now raiding public employees\u2019 retirement funds to make up for a budgetary shortfall of nearly $280 million. By contrast, neighboring Minnesota raised taxes on top earners in 2013 and now has one of the fastest growing economies in the nation. The state raised its minimum wage and balanced its budget without resorting to financial accounting games.The conservative tactic of attacking government during an election rarely translates into good governance. There\u2019s a reason why anti-government rhetoric remains vague and abstract: The public is often horrified to see highways and bridges deteriorate, public schools close and fire departments face crippling cutbacks.Formerly insurgent anti-government governors are now recognizing this fact. Unfortunately, despite their scrambles to raise revenue, many are not going about this task responsibly. Rather than reversing the tax cuts for their top donors, they are implementing regressive measures that draw most heavily from middle-class families. For example, Snyder\u2019s ballot initiative to increase infrastructure spending will be paid for with a sales-tax increase. This puts a heavy burden on families of modest means, who spend most of their incomes paying for basic necessities at retail stores.Brownback is taking a page from Walker\u2019s political playbook. Instead of asking his business friends to help address the state\u2019s fiscal crisis, he is raiding a pot of money accumulated by middle-class workers. As in Wisconsin, Kansas\u2019 tattered state budget is being mended with funds previously set aside for civil servants\u2019 pension plans. Compensation that public employees have put into the system for decades is being drained to pay for top-bracket tax cuts.That these governors now want to put their states on more stable financial grounds indicates that they are sobering up from their tea party bacchanalia. But gutting essential public services will only compound the economic woes of their constituents. Efforts to address budget troubles by using voodoo economics will only impose new burdens on the working families that are already hit hard by the lackluster economies these leaders created.",
    "When Eli Erlick was 8 years old, she would sometimes pretend to be sick, just so she could leave school and go home to use the bathroom. She had asked to use the girls\u2019 bathroom at her school in Mendocino County, California, but she wasn\u2019t allowed to.\u201cI had no idea why I couldn\u2019t do this,\u201d Erlick said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know the word \u2018transgender.\u2019 I just knew that I was a girl,\u201d she said, and so it didn\u2019t feel right to use the boys\u2019 bathroom. This continued until she was 13, when she began her gender transition.Erlick, now 19, is a second-year student at Pitzer College near Los Angeles and director of\u00a0Trans Student Education Resources (TSER), a student-led advocacy group. When she was a senior in high school, she worked to help craft California\u2019s\u00a0School Success and Opportunity Act, a 2013 law \u2014 the first of its kind in the nation \u2014 that requires the state\u2019s public schools to allow trans students to use the bathrooms and play on the sports teams that correspond with their gender identities.After that landmark legislation in California, some states are pushing in the other direction, and bathrooms and locker rooms are starting to become key battlegrounds in the nationwide fight for the rights of transgender children.\u201cMy story isn\u2019t uncommon at all,\u201d Erlick said. \u201cThere are thousands of trans youth who are being denied these resources every day.\u201dThis month, lawmakers in three states have proposed legislation that would limit transgender children from using facilities that correspond to their gender identities. Nevada Assemblywoman Victoria Dooling, a Republican,\u00a0proposed a bill on March 19\u00a0that would require kids at public schools to use the restrooms and showers that correspond to their biological sex at birth. Republican lawmakers in Minnesota put forth two bills in March that would require schoolchildren to use bathrooms and participate on the sports teams that match their gender at birth, and the Kentucky State Senate approved a similar bill.The Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law, a think tank that researches sexual orientation and gender identity,\u00a0released a study in 2013 about the effects of denying access to certain bathrooms on transgender individuals. The study found that nearly 60 percent of the transgender people it surveyed said they had avoided going out in public because of worries about safe access to public restrooms, and 54 percent said they had physical problems like dehydration or kidney infections from trying to avoid using public bathrooms.These proposed laws do offer some compromises: The Minnesota bill says schools would be required to provide \u201cplaces of public accommodation on the grounds of gender identity or expression.\u201d But advocates say that these laws are a clear signal that transgender children are not welcome in common spaces. Opponents of the Kentucky legislation call it the \u201cbathroom bully\u201d bill\u00a0because they say it would open the door for children to judge each other based on perceived gender identity.Other recent laws go even further. Lawmakers in Florida proposed a bill in February that applies to any sex-segregated public facility, not just in public schools, and calls for a $1,000 fine for violators and a potential prison term of up to a year. A bill introduced in the Texas legislature in February would bar someone from entering a locker room or bathroom meant for women if that person has a Y chromosome. Violating the law would be a felony, and attendants who repeatedly allow trans people to enter could be charged with a felony and do jail time,\u00a0according to the bill\u2019s text.Texas State Rep. Debbie Riddle, a Republican,\u00a0wrote in a Facebook post in January that the new bill \u201cwill protect women & children\u00a0from going into a ladies restroom & finding a man who feels like he is a woman that day.\u201dAdvocates for transgender rights say the increased visibility of transgender people in American culture in recent years is triggering this legislative backlash, particularly in states, such as Nevada, that\u00a0have already passed laws that protect transgender students or employees from gender discrimination.\u201cIt\u2019s a second bite of the apple for lawmakers who are not happy that their states or entities within their states had moved to protect students,\u201d said Michael Silverman, executive director of the New York City-based Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund.If these proposed bathroom bills do get signed into law, they are likely to face legal challenges. Gender identity and expression is included in Title IX of the Education Amendments Act, a 1972 law that protects all public school students from gender discrimination. \u201cThe Departments of Justice and Education have made it clear that they intend to protect transgender students from unequal treatment in school,\u201d Silverman said.At least two recent lawsuits have already successfully upheld access to bathrooms for transgender children. In 2013,\u00a0the family of Coy Mathis, a transgender first-grader, won a lawsuit against their Colorado school district\u00a0that allowed her to use the girls\u2019 bathroom. In 2014,\u00a0Maine's highest court ruled in favor of transgender student Nicole Maines\u00a0after she sued when her high school required her to use a separate restroom for staff.\u201cTransgender people are probably 20 years behind lesbian and gay people in terms of public understanding of who they are and public acceptance,\u201d Silverman said. \u201cThat makes the transgender community an easy scapegoat now for people who no longer target the gay and lesbian community because it won\u2019t be tolerated. We need to create the conditions where legislators know that they cannot target transgender people either.\u201d",

    "A dam-building boom across the developing world will bring electricity to growing, power-hungry cities across Asia, Africa and Latin America. But it can also put the world\u2019s climate and people at risk, according to a new study by researchers aiming to reduce the host of environmental problems that can come with dam construction.Researchers at T\u00fcbingen University in Germany have\u00a0have compiled a database\u00a0of the 3,700 different dam projects planned or underway worldwide. They predict that global hydropower capacity will double in the next 10 years \u2014 an increase set to reduce by 20 percent the number of free-flowing rivers left on Earth.The building boom also poses a hazard to the rich biodiversity of major river watersheds, including those of the Mekong, Amazon and Congo, on which millions depend.The database aims to be a resource for planners trying to reduce the environmental impact of such projects, according to the German study. The Berlin-based Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB) also took part in the project. The researchers released their study Friday in Copenhagen.Population growth, energy demand and concerns over global climate change have spurred the development of hydroelectric dams as an energy source, but the researchers say it is not a cure-all for a warming world.\u201cDespite the renewable nature of hydroelectricity, this technology also comes along with severe social and ecological adverse effects, e.g. relocation of people and transboundary conflicts, fragmentation of free-flowing rivers, habitat changes, thus further threatening freshwater biodiversity,\u201d the researchers said.Despite their \u201crenewable\u201d label, hydroelectric dams can lead to the production of greenhouse gases, especially methane, when plant matter decays beneath lakes that form behind dams. The gasses bubble up to the surface, and leak into the atmosphere.While the promise of more electricity is real, the growth in its availability \u201cwill only partially close the electricity gap, may not substantially reduce greenhouse gas emission (carbon dioxide and methane), and may not erase interdependencies and social conflicts,\u201d the study report says.Christiane Zarfl, the lead researcher on the project, said planners should take into account the effect of multiple dams on the same river system and the \u201ccumulative effect\u201d they have on the environment.The researchers said they hope their database will serve as a resource for planners trying to reduce the environmental impact of the often massive, years-long projects. People who live behind dams sometimes have to leave, as water levels rise and flood their homes. Authorities evicted 1.3 million of people living along the Yangtze River when China\u2019s Three Gorges Dam rose during the 2000s.\"Displacement of local human population, potential conflicts on the river as a water resource, river fragmentation and thus habitat degradation and extinction of species are other consequences that we should be aware of when to decide where and how to build and operate a hydropower dam,\" Zarfl said in an email, adding that even if all the planned dams come online, they'll only amount to 18 percent of the world's energy needs, up from 16 percent now.Zarfl and fellow researchers hope that their work will lead to more sustainable hydropower investment, but some environmental activists believe there is no such thing as a good dam.\u201cHydropower is inappropriately classified as renewable,\u201d said Jason Rainey, executive director of International Rivers, an environmental and human rights group. \u201cOnce a river is dammed, it can\u2019t be renewed.\u201dThe long-term effects of a dam, especially a mega-project like the Three Gorges, can be incalculable, uprooting people and plants, and altering the landscape itself.\u201cOf course developing countries need access to electricity to prosper, and the true renewables, that\u2019s wind, solar and geothermal, are no longer fringe or boutique, and they\u2019re quite cost-competitive,\u201d Rainey added, pointing to recent growth of the technology in sub-Saharan Africa.He called the failure to account for dams\u2019 climate impact a \u201ctravesty.\u201dRainey pointed to the planned Gibe 3 dam on the Omo River in Ethiopia as an example of a dam that will cause harm to area residents \u2014 including the 300,000 living around the desert lake that the river feeds, Lake Turkana, and the 200,000 people along the river. It will cut off the flow of water to the lake, which people rely on for drinking water and fishing, and it will disrupt the flow of the river, a lifeline in the desert.Rupak Thapaliya of the Hydropower Reform Coalition, a nonprofit dam-reform organization that works in the United States, said that the world can learn from U.S. blunders.Many dams built\u00a0across the U.S. during the 20th century\u00a0went up before their long-term impacts were known. Now, Thapaliya said environmentalists and regulators focus on reducing the impact these dams have on the environment, disrupting fish, flooding areas that were previously dry and depriving other places of the water that they had before.\u201cWe didn\u2019t know much about the ecosystem, and we didn\u2019t have the environmental laws we do,\u201d Thapaliya said. \u201cNow that we built those dams, we realize the mistakes we made.\u201d",
    "On a recent flight to Nicaragua, I found myself sitting next to a sergeant in the United States army and an American businessman seeking to open a sales office in Managua. If either of them had tried to visit Nicaragua in the 1980s, they wouldn\u2019t have made it past the airport.In those days Nicaragua was governed by the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), a leftist movement allied with Cuba and at war with the U.S.-backed Contra rebels. President Daniel Ortega proclaimed that \u201cour revolution is profoundly anti-imperialist, anti-Yankee and Marxist-Leninist.\u201d Ortega lost power in 1990 but returned to the presidency in 2006, where he remains today. This time, things are quite different.\u201cThe government is really eager to bring foreign companies to Nicaragua,\u201d said the businessman across the aisle from me. The sergeant, whose card says he works for \u201cOffice of Security Cooperation \u2014 Nicaragua,\u201d told me, \u201cWhenever the Nicaraguans ask the U.S. for military or security help, we try to respond.\u201dOrtega still calls himself a Sandinista. His rhetoric, full of scorn for \u201cimperialists\u201d and \u201cglobal capitalism\u2019s tyrannical dictatorship,\u201d still recalls Fidel Castro and Hugo Chavez. But everything else seems to have changed. By forging alliances with his former enemies, he has built a regime that appears likely to remain in power for a long time.The first step in Ortega\u2019s reinvention was reconciliation with the Roman Catholic hierarchy that had opposed him during the Contra war.\u00a0 His principal Catholic enemy in the 1980s, Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, became a fervent supporter after the Ortega government banned abortion without exception. Ortega cemented this alliance by taking advantage of the Cardinal\u2019s private weaknesses. In a cable made public by Wiki Leaks, the American ambassador to Nicaragua reported the widespread rumor \u201cthat Ortega is blackmailing Obando y Bravo with information proving that the Cardinal fathered children with his secretary and that he has engaged in corrupt practices in his management of the private Catholic University.\u201dThe second pillar of the new regime is big business. As an anticapitalist revolutionary, Ortega had confiscated hundreds of farms, factories and other assets. Many businessmen fled the country. Now Ortega counts them among his closest allies. He recently pushed a tax law through Congress giving a host of concessions to the wealthiest Nicaraguans and foreign investors. One provision allows the tax-free importation of yachts and executive helicopters. The flood of foreign investors now includes behemoths such as Cargill, the agro-industrial conglomerate that recently unveiled a \u201cmaster plan\u201d aimed at making it one of Nicaragua\u2019s major food producers and distributors.Third, and perhaps most important, among Ortega\u2019s allies is Rosario Murillo \u2014 First Lady, chief of communications and universally acknowledged power behind the throne. While her New Age mysticism has attracted attention, critics are more concerned by her opaque style of government. Murillo rules by fiat and her decisions are rarely contradicted. Key decisions are always made in private, and some are never announced.Murillo\u2019s hold on Ortega dates back to 1998, when she stood by him after her daughter accused him of prolonged sexual abuse. If Murillo had joined the chorus denouncing Ortega as a rapist, his public life almost certainly would have ended.\u00a0 Instead she defended him.Ortega\u2019s alliance with big business has yielded some positive results, including preventing the economic collapse some expected when he returned to power. But Nicaragua remains one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere. The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean recently reported that 74 percent of Nicaraguans live in \u201cmultidimensional poverty,\u201d compared to 28 percent of Latin Americans in general. The same report found that only 36 percent of Nicaraguans between the ages of 20 and 24 have completed high school. According to Transparency International, Nicaragua is perceived as the most corrupt country in Central America and the fourth most corrupt in the Western hemisphere.In the last year the Ortega government has begun promoting the idea of building an inter-oceanic canal in Nicaragua to compete with the one that traverses Panama. A mysterious Chinese businessman is supposed to provide billions of dollars in funding, though there have apparently been no serious studies of the project\u2019s financial, environmental or technical feasibility. Peasants who would lose their land have already risen up in protest, sometimes in the face of assaults by pro-Sandinista mobs.Controversy over the canal has led the government to intensify its efforts to control the press and public discourse. The project\u2019s critics include some of Nicaragua\u2019s leading cultural figures, such as the 90-year-old poet and former Sandinista culture minister Ernesto Cardenal, the feminist writer Gioconda Belli and the novelist Sergio Ramirez, who was Ortega\u2019s vice president in the 1980s. All three have been unofficially banned from speaking at public universities.Nicaragua\u2019s constitution forbids reelection, but Ortega controls the Supreme Court and in 2009 it ruled that he could run for unlimited terms. The bizarre rationale was that the anti-reelection clause in the constitution is unconstitutional because it violates another clause that guarantees equal rights to all Nicaraguans. Ortega, who also controls the Supreme Electoral Commission, is set to win another term next year. Some Nicaraguans expect that in the following election, set for 2021, he will hand the reins to his son Laureano, a leading advocate of the canal project. This would leave Laureano\u2019s mother, Murillo, in effective control.The prospect of a family dynasty is the most surreal aspect of Nicaragua\u2019s new political system. Ortega grew up under the dictatorship of the Somoza family, which endured for 40 years through the rule of a father and two sons. As a Sandinista leader, Ortega helped destroy this corrupt dynastic system. Now he is emulating it, turning into just the kind of pro-business autocrat he spent years of his life fighting.",
    "Kenya launched airstrikes against fighters from the armed group Al-Shabab in Somalia\u00a0after an attack on Garissa University College in eastern Kenya that killed 148 people, a military spokesman said Monday.In the first major military response to last week's attack, warplanes attacked two camps of\u00a0Al-Shabab\u00a0on Sunday afternoon and early Monday morning, said Col. David Obonyo of the Kenyan military.Al-Shabab, which is based in Somalia, claimed responsibility\u00a0for the April 2 attack in the Kenyan town of Garissa. Four gunmen died in the assault, which ended after a 15-hour siege. The group has killed more than 400 people in Kenya since April 2013.The airstrikes occurred in the Gedo region of Somalia, Obonyo said. \"This is part of continuing operations, not just in response to Garissa,\" he said.Jets pounded the camps in Gondodowe and Ismail, near the border with Kenya. Cloud cover made it difficult to establish how much damage the bombings caused or to estimate the death toll.Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta had vowed harsh measures against Al-Shabab after the attack on Garissa, which is near the border with Somalia. Kenya has troops in Somalia as part of an African Union force to attack Al-Shabab and shore up the beleaguered Somali government. Kenya has carried out airstrikes before, but it has struggled to stop the flow of Al-Shabab militants and weapons across its porous border with Somalia.Al-Shabab said it\u00a0attacked students at Garissa University College\u00a0in reprisal for Kenya\u2019s sending troops into Somalia. Nairobi decided in 2011 to provide troops to the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), with United Nations approval. The peacekeeping mission \u2014 which includes a military component that draws troops from\u00a0Ethiopia, Djibouti, Burundi, Sierra Leone and Uganda \u2014 was put together to root out Al-Shabab from its strongholds in southern and central\u00a0Somalia. The mission has counted a number of significant successes in recent years, such as the\u00a0recapturing\u00a0of important port cities along the Somali coast and the\u00a0killing\u00a0of several Al-Shabab leaders.In March, AMISOM\u00a0seized Kuday, an island off the port city of Kismayo that\u00a0Al-Shabab fighters\u00a0used\u00a0to smuggle contraband charcoal that it sells to Gulf states\u00a0to sustain its operations. The killing that month of Adnan Garaar, who allegedly helped plan the attack at the Westgate mall in Nairobi, by a U.S. drone also delivered an important blow to the organization,\u00a0the Pentagon reported. Much of the capital, Mogadishu, is back in the Somali government\u2019s hands, AMISOM reported, but car bombs and suicide attacks\u00a0continue\u00a0to rock the city.Al-Shabab, Somalia's largest armed group, started out as one of many factions fighting the U.N.-backed transitional federal government, based in Mogadishu. Al-Shabab morphed into what the United States labeled a terrorist organization after staging attacks on prominent foreign and national targets.Al Jazeera and wire services",
    "CAPE TOWN, South Africa \u2014 The statue of Cecil John Rhodes, situated high on the campus of the University of Cape Town, usually gives the old colonialist a magnificent view of the city, of the land that he once ruled, developed and exploited for his personal profit.But his line of sight has been blocked lately, first covered by black garbage bags that appeared after a recent \u201cpoo protest\u201d in which protesters flung human excrement on the statue, calling it a symbol of racist and colonial oppression. Since then it also has been covered in tape, graffiti and posters. Most recently, the statue has been covered by boards, boxed up until a final decision is made on where to move it.\u201cThe issue of poo is very metaphoric for us,\u2019\u2019 said protest leader Chumani Maxwele. \u201cWe\u2019re using metaphor for us to explain our collective black pain. We show our collective disgust.\u201dWriter T.O. Molefe noted that many of the students protesting were able to go to the same schools and live in the same social circles as their white counterparts. However, they still did not feel fully integrated.\u201cThey show that the Rainbow Nation was a glossy overlay on a messy society that has yet to come to terms the effects of a brutal and unequal past on the present. They show, too, that the Rainbow Nation overlay was perhaps an impediment to reckoning,\u201d Molefe said.The protest has not been without critics. Many South Africans, including fellow students, have been loud in their condemnation, with some hurling racist vitriol at the students, particularly over social media.\u201cIf our fellow students are themselves racist, it shows its not a safe space,\u201d said Thandeka, an activist who did not want to give any other name because she receives a scholarship from the university.\u201cA friend of mine asked me \u2018Why are you acting like a kaffir?\u2019\u201d she said, referring to a racist pejorative.Many white students had joined the protest early on, agreeing that the statue should be removed. Some even joined the occupation of a campus building, sharing bedrolls and meals with black students.

    "Sri Lanka's new government has ordered a criminal investigation into alleged corruption at the state-run national airline that it says involved \u201cbillions of dollars.\u201dPrime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's office said an inquiry, led by an anti-corruption lawyer, had found \u201cshocking details of corruption\u00a0running into billions of dollars\u201d at SriLankan Airlines, as well as \u201cirregularities\u201d in its $2.3 billion 2013 deal to buy 10 Airbus aircraft.The statement, issued on Saturday, contained no allegations of wrongdoing by Airbus.Airbus said it had no comment on the Sri Lanka government statement. The inquiry recommended investigations into the national carrier's \u201centire re-fleeting process,\u201d according to the statement.The statement also said that former airline chairman Nishantha Wickremasinghe, who it identified as a brother-in-law of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, \u201cshould be prosecuted.\u201dEfforts to contact Wickremasinghe for comment were unsuccessful.Wickremasinghe resigned as the airline's chairman shortly after Rajapaksa, who had been Sri Lankan president for 10 years, was defeated in a January election by Maithripala Sirisena.The statement also said staff at the airline had knowingly ignored conflicts of interest with companies and individuals it hired, and that the inquiry found cases of the manipulation of contracts.It also alleged that Rajapaksa changed the management of the loss-making airline, which is 51 percent government-owned, to ensure the purchase of the Airbus planes despite the availability of cheaper alternatives.Rohan Weliwita, Rajapaksa's media coordinator, said on Sunday the former president had no comment yet on the government statement.The corruption allegations are the latest in a series leveled at Rajapaksa by President Sirisena, who has ordered an investigation into all financial deals sealed by his predecessor.Rajapaksa and former government officials have rejected the allegations and said they are ready to face any investigation.Since Rajapaksa\u2019s defeat in the Jan. 8\u00a0presidential elections, complaints have flooded a Sri Lankan anti-graft commission alleging huge corruption by members of his administration.The ex-leader himself faces allegations that he tried to use military force and remain in office when it became clear during the vote count that he was headed for a defeat.Al Jazeera and Reuters",
    "Indiana Gov. Mike Pence on Thursday approved a fix to\u00a0the wording of the state\u2019s\u00a0controversial \u201creligious freedom\u201d act, clarifying that the measure does not allow for businesses to discriminate against certain groups. It followed widespread criticism that the law, as originally written,\u00a0could be used to refuse service\u00a0to LGBT people.The language added to the bill says unambiguously that Indiana\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) may not be used as a legal defense for companies to decline services, goods, public accommodation, employment or housing on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation.Explaining the amendment, statehouse Speaker Brian Bosma, a Republican, said, \u201cWhat was intended as a message of inclusion was interpreted as exclusion for the LGBT community. Nothing was further from the truth, but it was clear that the perception had to be addressed.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe\u2019ll be releasing what we believe is a very strong statement to make sure every Hoosier\u2019s rights are protected and won\u2019t be infringed upon by the enactment of RFRA.\u201d\u201cReligious rights and individual rights can exist in harmony,\u201d said Senate President Pro Tem David Long, also a Republican. \u201cHoosier hospitality is not just a saying. It\u2019s a way of life, and I hope people come to understand that.\u201dThe Indiana law attracted the ire of gay activists as well as the business community \u2014 including several of the state's biggest corporations \u2014 late last week after Pence, a Republican, signed it into law.State lawmakers voted through the amended language,\u00a0and Pence signed off on it. It is the first protection explicitly extended to LGBT people in Indiana law.\u201cDozens of people have struggled together to find the right words to allow us to move past this crisis,\u201d said former Indianapolis Mayor Bart Peterson, now the CEO of Indiana-based pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly. \u201cThey found the words because the future of Indiana was at stake and they value the future of our state above a desire to win, above a need for ideological purity, above the demands of politics.\u201dThe compromise language did not fully quell the anger of LGBT advocates, some of whom have called for repealing the law or for gays and lesbians to be listed as a protected class under Indiana\u2019s anti-discrimination statutes.\u201cThe harm has been lessened, but we have not reached the day when LGBT Hoosiers can be assured that they can live their lives with freedom from discrimination,\u201d Katie Blair, the campaign manager of the LGBT group Freedom Indiana, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s long past time to enact a comprehensive nondiscrimination law, and we must continue to work to ensure, once and for all, that the RFRA cannot be used to discriminate against or hurt anyone.\u201d",
    "The Nicaraguan government and a Chinese development company have started work on what they claim is the world\u2019s largest infrastructure project: a new canal to connect the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea. Three times as large as the Panama Canal, the $50 billion project will speed shipping time for supertankers taking shale oil and liquefied natural gas from the Eastern United States to energy-hungry Asia. Supporters say the canal and related projects will create over 250,000 jobs.That\u2019s if the canal gets built. I went to Nicaragua in order to sort through the wildly different claims by canal supporters and critics.Opponents emphasize the lack of government transparency and potential environmental problems the canal would create. They argue the project would wreak havoc on Lake Nicaragua, Central America\u2019s largest body of freshwater, and disrupt bird and wildlife habitats.But I found that many ordinary Nicaraguans I interviewed were more concerned about jobs than flora and fauna. They look forward to what the government promises will be massive foreign investment, which it claims will not only create 50,000 temporary construction jobs but also 200,000 permanent jobs at anticipated ancillary projects such as ports, an airport, factories and tourist resorts.An overwhelming 71 percent of Nicaraguans living far from the canal route support it, according to a December poll by M&R Consultants. But support drops to 42 percent among those living along the canal\u2019s path.Hong Kong Nicaragua Development (HKND), the company building the canal, admits that the project will displace about 35,000 people, mostly campesinos (peasant farmers) and indigenous tribes living near the Atlantic coast. Campesinos have become the backbone of the anti-canal movement. Thousands have marched, with dozens arrested and injured in clashes with Nicaraguan police.And here\u2019s where things get really interesting. At first glance, the struggle looks like poor campesinos and environmentalists facing repression from the leftist Sandinista government. But in reality, the Sandinista leaders gave up their revolutionary fervor years ago. Nicaragua\u2019s President Daniel Ortega has led the Sandinistas toward the political center and allied with the big businessmen backing the canal.The opposition includes leftist critics of the newly moderate Sandinistas, along with the conservative daily La Prensa, conservative political parties and some Contras, the U.S.-backed counterrevolutionaries who fought a civil war against the Sandinista government in the 1980s. Canal supporters and opponents denounce each other with a passion not seen since that era.Nicaragua is \u201cno longer a popular or leftist revolution,\u201d said Ernesto Cardinal, a former Sandinista leader and the country\u2019s most famous poet. \u201cIt\u2019s a personal dictatorship of Ortega and his wife.\u201dAmid all the angry rhetoric, one question remains: Can Nicaragua build a canal that benefits ordinary people, mitigates the project\u2019s environmental impact and serves international trade?Let\u2019s take a look at some of the key controversies.Politicians, including those in the U.S., regularly exaggerate the number of jobs that will be created by large infrastructure projects. Once completed, the canal will employ relatively few people. The claim that the canal will provide the promised 200,000 permanent jobs at ports, an airport, a free trade zone and tourist resorts depends on whether those projects get built.Raul Calvet, the president of a business-consulting firm in Managua, said that for every job at the Panama Canal, five were created in ancillary industries. As for Nicaragua, he said, \u201cWho can calculate the exact number of jobs?\u201dBenjamin Lanzas, head of a construction industry trade association, estimates the canal and related projects will provide 25,000 construction jobs for Nicaraguans and 25,000 for Chinese and other foreigners with specialized skills. So far the project has employed some 200 Nicaraguan construction workers. Employment should increase later this year as HKND builds worker housing and port facilities on the Pacific and Caribbean coasts.Campesino leaders on Ometepe Island in the middle of Lake Nicaragua said HKND will use dynamite to dredge the lake to a depth of 80 to 100 feet. That will destroy local fisheries, canal opponents say, and maintenance dredging will pollute the water supplies of dozens of nearby cities.Leonel Teller \u2014 a former Nicaraguan ambassador to the European Union, a former Contra leader and a canal supporter \u2014 flatly denies dynamite will be used in the lake. He notes that the lake is already heavily polluted from river sediment and fish can\u2019t live anywhere except close to shore. The dredging, he said, is \u201cfar enough from shore so as not to disturb the [fish] population or the shore of the lake or the island.\u201dIt is possible to dredge a lake without destroying its ecology, but that requires careful, scientific planning and sophisticated construction techniques. It remains to be seen if HKND and its subcontractors can handle the task.Opponents argue that the Chinese government is manipulating the canal project behind the scenes \u2014 part of political plan to colonize Latin America. One opponent said China is prepared to lose tens of billions of dollars on the project to establish a political beachhead in Nicaragua. Others go further and claim China is planning to create a military base on Ometepe Island.A Chinese diplomat, who asked for anonymity because he\u2019s not authorized to speak to the media, tells me that the Chinese government favors the canal but is not involved in the day-to-day decision-making. The Chinese government hopes to benefit economically and politically from the project but has no agenda beyond getting faster and cheaper delivery of oil and other key natural resources.It\u2019s absurd to claim China will establish a military base in Nicaragua. Canal opponents must be confusing China with the United States. China has no military bases outside its territory and, as a practical matter, wouldn\u2019t risk U.S. anger by establishing one in Nicaragua.In 2012 the Nicaraguan National Assembly passed a canal law that would have given the government 51 percent ownership and substantial revenues from the canal. Any canal contractor would have had to follow national and international environmental laws.Then in 2013 the Assembly completely revised the law in just a few days. Under the new terms, HKND owns the canal and transfers 10 percent to the Nicaraguan government every 10 years. The government won\u2019t achieve majority ownership for 51 years and will receive a measly $1 million per year in fees. Critics call this a sellout of the country\u2019s sovereignty.Teller argues that Nicaragua cut the best deal it could. \u201cThe law has to be very favorable for those foreign investors who will put that kind of money in a developing nation,\u201d he said.Under the current law, HKND is providing worse financial terms than the U.S. ultimately negotiated for the Panama Canal, which gave full ownership to Panama after 65 years. If the law is not revised, the issue of sovereignty and ongoing revenues will haunt Ortega\u2019s and future administrations.HKND President Wang Jin has reportedly put up $200 million of his own money so far. HKND says it has additional investors lined up from China, Britain, Australia and the U.S. At least so far, the investors are also major subcontractors, which stand to profit from building the ports, dredging the waterways and doing related work. HKND has not made public the names of other investors, if any.HKND has announced plans to offer securities on a stock exchange to raise additional funds. But which stock exchange? International stock investors will want a great deal more financial transparency than HKND has offered. Without additional financing, HKND will have a hard time completing the canal \u2014 let alone the subsidiary projects.So what can we expect in the near future? First, HKND plans to buy up land along the canal route. If HKND leaders are smart, they will pay generously for the land and take special care to relocate the campesinos to areas where they can improve their standard of living. Spending a few tens of millions of dollars is a relative drop in the bucket and would go a long way to meet protesters\u2019 demands. But that assumes the HKND leaders are politically savvy.Meanwhile, protests will likely continue. Government leaders and protesters aren\u2019t talking to each other yet, much less considering possible compromises. It\u2019s possible to build a canal that fairly treats displaced residents and mitigates environmental effects. But can Nicaragua achieve that difficult task? Stay tuned.",
    "The University of Virginia fraternity chapter\u00a0at the center of a now-discredited Rolling Stone rape article\u00a0says the story was defamatory and reckless and they are pursuing legal action against the magazine.Phi Kappa Psi said Monday in a statement that the widely read and circulated article led to vandalism of the fraternity house and members being ostracized.The fraternity's statement came as the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism released a report Sunday night, saying the magazine's shortcomings \"encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking.\"The article said a woman named \"Jackie\" was gang-raped at the fraternity house. Police\u00a0say there is no evidence the attack took place.The Rolling Stone article, written by contributing editor Sabrina Rubin Erdely and published in November, detailed an alleged 2012 gang rape that a first-year student identified as \"Jackie\" said she had endured at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house. It also accused the university of tolerating a culture that ignored sexual violence against women.But in December, after coming under a barrage of questions about the story's veracity,\u00a0Rolling Stone apologized for \"discrepancies\" in the account\u00a0and admitted that it never sought comment from seven men\u00a0accused of the alleged rape.\"Rolling Stone's repudiation of the main narrative in 'A Rape on Campus' is a story of journalistic failure that was avoidable,\" the Columbia team wrote in the report, which the magazine requested and published on its website.Steve Coll, dean of Columbia\u2019s journalism school, led the review of the story.In an editor's note printed at the top of the report, Rolling Stone Managing Editor Will Dana said the magazine was officially retracting the article\u00a0and apologized \"to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout.\"It is important that rape victims feel comfortable stepping forward, Dana wrote, \"and it saddens us to think that their willingness to do so might be diminished by our failings.\"The magazine's founding editor, Jann Wenner, said in an interview with the New York Times on Sunday that the botched story was an isolated episode and that Erdely would continue to write for the magazine. He also said neither Dana nor Sean Woods, who edited the article, would lose their jobs.While Dana said in his note that Rolling Stone would commit itself to following \"a series of recommendations about journalistic practices that are spelled out in the report,\" the report itself said \"Rolling Stone's senior editors are unanimous in the belief that the story's failure does not require them to change their editorial systems.\"Wire services",
    "Ellen Pao, the woman who sued the powerful venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers for sex discrimination and lost, said Monday that more work needs to be done to address gender discrimination.\u201cYou need to work through these issues,\u201d Pao\u00a0told The Wall Street Journal in an article published Monday, \u201cbecause they are here and they\u2019re not going to go away.\u201dIn her first interviews since\u00a0a 12-person jury rejected four counts of gender discrimination against Kleiner Perkins on March 26, Pao also told broadcast journalist Katie Couric that while the scrutiny heaped upon her during the trial was difficult, she had been buoyed by the messages of support she had received from people all over the world.\u201cYou start out, and you\u2019re just one person,\u201d Pao told Couric in an interview released online Monday on Yahoo.com. \u201cIt\u2019s become something that\u2019s much beyond me.\u201dWhen Couric asked how she would respond to those who say that her case was \u201cthe right issue at the right time,\u201d but that she was \u201cthe wrong example\u201d of gender discrimination, Pao shrugged it off.\u201cIt\u2019s happening to everyone, and there is no right example or wrong example,\u201d Pao told Couric.\u201cI\u2019ve told my story to highlight what the problem is, and if people don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s fine,\u201d she added. \u201cGo find somebody else, but this is my story, and this is something that happens to everybody and they should think about the message and what\u2019s happening and not try to focus on me. It\u2019s not about me.\u201dPao, who is now interim CEO at the user-generated news site Reddit, told the Wall Street Journal that women were too often being asked to embody stereotypically masculine and feminine traits in order to succeed at work, creating impossible-to-meet double standards.\u201cYou have this needle that you have to thread, and sometimes it feels like there\u2019s no hole in the needle,\u201d Pao said. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard from women, they do feel like there\u2019s no way to win. They can\u2019t be aggressive and get this opportunity without being treated like they\u2019ve done something wrong.\u201dWhen Couric asked Pao what kinds of changes she\u2019d like to see made with respect to women in the workplace, Pao said she\u2019d like to see companies invest in more diverse employees, including women and minorities. \u201cI\u2019d love to see a day where there are 50 percent women in these really powerful institutions that have a huge impact on what technology and what services are brought to the world,\u201d Pao said. \u201cIf we can do that, I\u2019ll be very happy.\u201d",
    "Workers were set to break ground Monday for the construction of Nicaragua's controversial $50 billion canal linking the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. The mega-project \u2014 widely reported as the world\u2019s largest civil engineering enterprise \u2014\u00a0has been shrouded in secrecy and has outraged farmers, indigenous communities and citizens around the country. Vice President Mois\u00e9s Omar Halleslevens and Chinese firm HKND Group inaugurated the canal in a ceremony in the southwestern municipality of Rivas, Nicaraguan media reported.The canal, scheduled for completion in December 2019, will cut across the middle of the country and bisect Lake Nicaragua, known locally as Lake Colcibolca \u2014 the second-largest lake in Latin America and the largest drinking-water reservoir in the region. The canal will also cut through the Cerro Silva Nature Reserve.Projected to span 173 miles, the canal would be the realization of a dream that has been studied and discarded multiple times since the early 1800s. Backers say it will lift many out of poverty in Nicaragua, the second-poorest country in the Western Hemisphere after Haiti.Earlier this month, residents of Obrajuelo, a sleepy fishing village on the banks of Lake Nicaragua, threw stones at an SUV carrying a Chinese team that showed up to survey the land. The following day, the residents burned tires on the Pan-American Highway, blocking it for hours. On Dec. 10, as many as 5,000 people marched through the capital, Managua. Even though protesters complained that police blocked canal opponents trying to arrive from the countryside, observers said it was the largest anti-government action in years.Such political opposition is virtually unheard of in a country where President Daniel Ortega's Sandinista party dominates all branches of government. The president and his wife, the government's powerful communications chief, keep a tight lid on dissent.\"What it shows is that a significant part of the Nicaraguan people have not bought into the canal project,\" said Francisco Aguirre-Sacasa, an economist, former Nicaraguan foreign minister and ex-ambassador to the United States. \"A demonstration of that size, despite the impediments that were put in the way of it, shows that the government is playing with fire in this case.\"The Nicaragua canal is the latest and largest example of China\u2019s growing influence in Latin America. The project is set to be developed and operated by HKND, a Chinese infrastructure development firm registered in Hong Kong. CEO and chairman Wang Jing is a successful but virtually unknown telecoms executive with no experience in large-scale civil engineering projects like building a canal.Despite this, Ortega's allies in Congress fast-tracked legislation last year granting HKND a 50-year concession, renewable for another 50, to build and operate the canal in return for a payment of $10 million a year once it's up and running.As a note of comparison, Panama \u2014 Nicaragua\u2019s economically larger and more stable southern neighbor \u2014 held a national referendum to approve its $5.25 billion canal expansion.In addition to the canal, Nicaragua will allow HKND to develop ancillary projects including two ports, an airport, roads, a railway and a tourist resort \u2014 even if the canal never gets built. Congress also passed a law giving Wang hiring and land-expropriating powers, and exempting his company from local tax and commercial regulations.While Ortega promises the project will create 50,000 jobs and boost the country\u2019s economic growth to 14.6 percent in 2016 from 4.5 percent in 2013, skepticism abounds. Many of the canal's financial, technical and environmental plans have been kept secret.Late last month, HKND announced that the environmental and social reports had been completed, and had found the impact would be minimal. The reports, however, are not available for public review.Project supporters say the canal will rival Panama's, allowing passage to ships too large for the narrower Panama canal.According to financial statements of the Panama Canal Authority, canal revenue totals $1.6 billion annually. So even if the Nicaragua canal took all of Panama\u2019s business, it would take more than 30 years to pay off the initial cost, not including interest.The numbers point to the possibility of geopolitical motives outweighing the business opportunity.According to Hong Kong\u2019s South China Morning Post newspaper, the Nicaragua canal is seen by some Western critics as \u201cBeijing\u2019s back-door plan to make Nicaragua, an ally of Taiwan, switch allegiance to the mainland.\u201dHowever, Wang insists the venture is an independent commercial project.Adding to concerns, it's not clear that HKND has even raised its $8 billion in initial financing.Asked about investment, HKND told AP that it has \"received many contacts from the business sectors and will release [a] progress report at a proper time.\"Construction was set to begin at the mouth of the Brito river on Nicaragua's Pacific coast. If completed, the canal will then run across Lake Nicaragua, through rainforest and at least 40 villages requiring resettlement. The canal will then terminate at the mouth of river Punta Gorda in the southern Caribbean.The project will require massive dredging in Lake Nicaragua, as only about 10 percent of the lake meets the required depth for the canal, according to an investigation by Nicaraguan weekly paper\u00a0La Confidencial.Among the nearly 30,000 Nicaraguans who live in the path of the route, many fear the canal does not have to be completed for its environmental impact to be devastating.Environmentalists have warned that the canal could destroy sensitive habitats and cloud Lake Nicaragua's waters. They are calling for an independent environmental impact assessment that properly studies potential damage to things like biodiversity and water quality in Lake Nicaragua, as well as coral reefs and animal migratory patterns.The area is also susceptible to earthquakes.HKND hired the respected U.K.-based consulting firm Environmental Resources Management about a year ago to assess the environmental and social impact of the project. In a written response to questions from the AP, HKND said the reports would be submitted for approval by the Canal Commission and the government in early 2015.Telemaco Talavera, rector of the National Agrarian University and spokesman for Nicaragua's Canal Commission, said a number of changes were being made based on the studies' recommendations, such as relocating the planned Pacific port to protect mangroves and shifting the entry to the Caribbean to protect indigenous villages and fish populations.Rather than dredge the lakebed to make it deep enough for large vessels,\u00a0Talavera said, the project will use machines to suction the soil in order to keep upturned sediment from clouding the water and shutting down photosynthesis.Talavera also promised that the canal commission will require the company to pay a fair price for land, rejecting rumors that HKND will be allowed to run roughshod over property owners.But the project, which some opponents call Ortega's pipe dream, is provoking growing anger, particularly among the autonomous indigenous communities \u2014 such as Rama, Garifuna, Mayangna, Miskitu and Ulwa \u2014 that it threatens.Esteban Ruiz was a conscripted Sandinista soldier during the Contra War of the 1980s, during which he said he fled from battles because he didn't want to have to kill anyone.Now, as the 47-year-old farmer prepares to fight for his land, which sits in the evangelical-dominated community of Rio Grande in the path of the canal, Ruiz said, \"I'm not going to run.\"With wire services",
    "It has been seven months since Michael Brown\u2019s death triggered a national conversation about race and prejudiced policing, with Ferguson, Missouri, at its center.\u00a0Next week the town will hold its first City Council elections since the fatal shooting \u2014 one that could markedly change the racial makeup of the city\u2019s leaders.Two-thirds of Ferguson residents are black, yet the current six-member City Council has only one black member. In the upcoming elections, there are three open seats: one ward has only white candidates; another, only black candidates.All eyes are on in Ward 1, where there are two black and two white candidates. The victor will determine whether Ferguson\u2019s City Council\u00a0remains mostly white or divided equally between black and white members.\u201cAmerica Tonight\u201d visited Ferguson to meet two Ward 1 candidates with very different visions for their hometown. Mike McGrath, who is white, wants Ferguson to return to a time of stability, when race wasn't such an explosive issue. After serving on the city\u2019s planning and zoning committee for eight years, he says the City Council is the next step.Adrienne Hawkins, who is black, believes that Ferguson is racially divided and that more needs to be done to support the black community. Once a single mother on government assistance, she is now a federal employee with a master\u2019s degree and two sons in college. Their answers have been edited for space and clarity.McGrath: I really care about this town. I need to be on that council to help fix the things that need to be fixed and keep this community going forward. I will admit, after the event in August [and] when the grand jury announcement was made, it put some trepidation in whether I wanted to run. We were painted with a huge racist brush, and we still are.Hawkins: It was the death of Michael Brown. Just the thought of my children not returning home from walking down the street was way too much to handle. And something had to change. I watched the protests, and I watched the women rise. And it filled me with hope, and I was like, \"All they need is some direction, so somebody has to lead by example. Why not me?\" Because the different candidates who began to rise, they weren't the candidates that I felt could lead Ferguson out of this.Hawkins: Ferguson is divided. A lot of people don't want to admit that Ferguson is divided or has been divided, but I come from the side of Ferguson where most of the action occurred, and I've always felt a little disconnected.I think that in order to deal with an issue, you have to address an issue. If you dance around the issue, you still have a problem. It's a powder keg, and one day it's going to blow a lot larger than it did in August and November. We have to acknowledge the elephant in the room or somebody could get hurt.McGrath: I didn't believe [the protests] were warranted. I was on the side of the law and order, not the protesters. I used to volunteer with the police department, so I knew most of the people involved that were there responding to it.Hawkins: It was overwhelming for me. It touched me deeply, and I was afraid for the safety of the young people, because of anger that they carried with them, and I didn't want to witness anybody else getting hurt.McGrath: It was never an issue before. I wish it wasn't now. It shouldn't be. It should be the candidate and not their race. I understand that there are going to be people that are not going to look towards qualifications. If I was the race that has been disenfranchised and I didn't see any of my race on the council, I'd be tending to vote that way. I hope they don't, for my sake, but I can understand if they do.Hawkins: I don't like to think in terms of race, but it's huge. If you look at the people who decided to run, for instance, you have people who represent the way Ferguson has always been, then you have people who want Ferguson to change. So most of the people who are happy with the way Ferguson always been happen to be white. I love Ferguson, but I need Ferguson to be more diverse and more inclusive.The report cleared Darren Wilson, the white officer who killed Brown, but found a pervasive pattern of racially biased policing in Ferguson.McGrath: We did not expect it to be a rosy report. They went in with an agenda. Their agenda originally was to make Officer Wilson look guilty. The more they investigated, the more it validated the grand jury's findings that Officer Wilson was justified in his actions and was defending himself. Some of their other findings, they cherry-picked. You can do that with statistics. I'm not saying it's not valid. But I don't think it's as bad as they try to make it seem.Hawkins: I was sickened by it. It's one thing to hear and to know that something is one-sided. But to have it proven in writing? It was really sickening for me, and it was difficult for me to read the report. If there's a problem with a large portion of the community, then something is wrong. Whether you choose to believe how it was reported or not, we need to fix those things.McGrath: Trying to have a few more town hall meetings and getting citizens involved. When there's a disaster, people get involved. When they get comfortable, they become disinvolved. But if you really want to make a difference, then you have to be involved in the process. And when you're more involved, more things get done.McGrath: When I talk to people, the overwhelmingly No. 1 complaint everybody has is \u201cmy streets.\u201d No matter what shape their streets are in, that's all I hear about. And second in line, it's the school districts. We have little pockets that aren't part of the actual main school district, and that kind of hurts. It makes people disenfranchised. The people who live there, their kids don't go to the school district.Hawkins: Fear. There's fear on the side of most of the African-Americans who feel in disparate situations. I think it's the fear that the system won't ever change, won't ever be fair, won't ever offer them opportunity, won't ever give them any justice. And then on the other side, there's fear of losing white privilege, which a lot of people don't acknowledge that they have. There's fear that things will change and be different for them. There's fear that the black people will rise up and attack them. It's fear on all sides. All I hear is fear.McGrath: Mainly based on my qualifications and experience. The other three people seem like nice people, but until this election, they had done nothing. I care about this town. I care about the people, the community. This is my family. So I want to do what I think I can do to help make my family better. Because this [is] where I'm going to die.Hawkins: I'm empowered, and I know that I can do this.

    "Yemen's Houthis are ready to sit down for peace talks as long as a Saudi-led air campaign is halted and the negotiations are overseen by \"non-aggressive\" parties, a senior Houthi member said.The Houthi response came a day after Russia called an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council and circulated a draft resolution demanding \"regular and obligatory\" breaks in airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition against Houthi Shia rebels to allow foreign personnel to leave the country. Echoing Russia on Saturday, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) also called for an immediate pause in hostilities to deliver life-saving medical aid.\"We have received permission from the coalition for two planes now, one carrying supplies and one with staff,\" ICRC spokeswoman Sitara Jabeen told Reuters on Sunday.The ICRC hoped that the aircraft could land on Monday in the capital Sanaa, she said. However, it was still awaiting approval for an ICRC surgical team it plans to bring by boat into the southern city of Aden, where fighting remains intense.In Riyadh, a spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition said arrangements had been made for at least one Red Cross aid delivery on Sunday morning, but the ICRC had pulled out of the arrangement.Saleh al-Sammad, a senior figure in the Houthi leadership who was an adviser to President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, told Reuters over email that Yemenis reject the return of Hadi, who escaped to Saudi Arabia 11 days ago after the Houthi fighters edged closer to his southern base of Aden last month.Warplanes and ships from a Saudi-led coalition have been bombing the Iran-allied Houthi forces for 11 days, saying they are trying drive back the Houthis and restore Hadi. U.N. brokered peace talks in the preceding weeks between Hadi and the Houthis had failed.\"We still stand by our position on dialogue and we demand its continuation despite everything that has happened, on the basis of respect and acknowledging the other,\" Sammad said.\"We have no conditions except a halt to the aggression and sitting on the dialogue table within a specific time period ... and any international or regional parties that have no aggressive positions towards the Yemeni people can oversee the dialogue,\" Sammad said, without specifying who they might be.Sammad added that he wanted the dialogue sessions aired to the Yemeni people \"so that they can know who is the obstructer.\u201dThis weekend, Houthi forces rounded up and detained more than 120 members of the rival Islah party, the Yemeni Muslim Brotherhood branch, the Houthis said on their website Sunday.Also Sunday, Houthi forces advanced to near the port of Mualla, with airstrikes targeting the group's strongholds. Mualla is defended by militiamen of \"popular committees\" loyal to President Hadi.But just hours later, they were pushed back by pro-Hadi fighters.\u00a0A pro-Hadi militia source told Reuters 36 Houthi were killed near the port, while 11 of Hadi's combatants died.Aden residents reported hearing sporadic gunfire and blasts of rocket-propelled grenades.Summer Nasser, a human rights activist and blogger, told Al Jazeera that she had to leave her home in Aden because of the fighting.\"Conditions are devastating actually. We've heard shelling by Houthis on homes, civilians killed. There's no electricity, water. I feel like the humanitarian crisis in Aden is actually getting worse by the hour,\" she said.Television footage purports to show coalition warships bombing Houthi ammunition supply lines and depots from sea.Aden, the last foothold of supporters of Hadi, has been shaken by more than a week of fierce clashes between the Shia rebels and Hadi loyalists.At least 185 dead and 1,282 wounded from the clashes have been counted in hospitals in Aden since March 26, the city's health department director al-Kheder Lassouar said on Saturday.\u00a0The United Nations says more than 500 people have been killed in the past two weeks in Yemen and nearly 1,700 wounded.Airstrikes in the southern city of Dhale, close to Aden, killed at least five civilians on Sunday, medical officials told the Associated Press.Saudi Arabia's King Salman was quoted as saying Monday that the kingdom was ready for a political meeting of Yemeni parties, under the auspices of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Five out of the six GCC member states are part of the military coalition bombing which is bombing the Houthis.Houthi fighters seized the capital Sanaa six months ago and last month launched an offensive on the south, backed by army units loyal to longtime ruler Ali Abdullah Saleh.That prompted Saudi Arabia to launch a campaign of airstrikes on March 26 alongside regional Sunni Muslim Arab allies.The conflict has turned Yemen into another front in Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia's proxy war with Shia rival Iran, a struggle which is also playing out in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq.Tehran denies Riyadh's charges that its arms the Houthis, and Sammad dismissed the accusations as rumors. \"Even if there was Iranian support as is being said, it is not an excuse for this flagrant aggression,\" he said.Sammad denied the Houthis want control of the south, home to a long-running secessionist movement, and said they were focused on confronting the threat from Al-Qaeda.\"The sons of the south will run their own affairs, and they will have the more prominent role in the coming political scene,\" he said.Al Jazeera and wire services",
    "Four decades after Richard Nixon declared drugs\u00a0\u201cpublic enemy No. 1 in the United States,\u201d\u00a0the tide has turned on marijuana legalization. States are racing to follow Colorado and Washington in ending prohibition, and national politicians are scrambling to get out of the way.In the Senate, big names from both parties support a bill \u2014 the Compassionate Access, Research Expansion and Respect States (CARERS) Act \u2014 that would move marijuana out of Schedule I, the designation for heroin and other drugs with \u201cno currently accepted medical use,\u201d and into Schedule II, a group of substances that doctors can prescribe under certain circumstances. And in an interview with Vice\u2019s Shane Smith, President Barack Obama tacitly confirmed that the federal government would now let individual states proceed at their own pace. Think of it as the gay marriage strategy for surviving social change while in national office: Stay agnostic and let the states take care of it.But marijuana legalization and marriage equality are more different than they first appear. For one thing, in its more prohibitionist days, the federal government already established its primacy over state drug laws. In the 2005 Supreme Court decision Gonzales v. Raich, a confusing 6-3 ruling (with Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, Clarence Thomas and William Rehnquist dissenting), the court ruled against a California medical marijuana patient whose use was legal under state law. The justices found that the commerce clause allows Congress to regulate the interstate drug market and that the only way to do that effectively is to regulate drug use within states.The Drug Enforcement Agency operates according to the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), not state law, and \u201cIt\u2019s legal within city limits!\u201d is not a defense the feds recognize. The Obama administration has said it will exercise discretion, but you can hardly count on the government not to enforce the law.Because the Constitution requires states to give \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d to legal proceedings in other states, same-sex couples could challenge their home state to recognize a marriage performed elsewhere. But there\u2019s no constitutional right to smoke and no obvious way for individuals to sue for their weed, even if it\u2019s medicinal and legal under a revised federal law. As public records, marriage licenses fall under the full faith and credit clause, but prescriptions do not. Oregon State Appeals Court Judge Ronald D. Thom confirmed as much in 2010, when he ruled against Joel Dennis Berringer, a California medical marijuana patient who thought his prescription would be recognized in Oregon, which also has a medical marijuana law. Thom ruled that Berringer\u2019s arrest for possession was legitimate, since California law could protect him only from California law enforcement. Cases like this one show that marijuana legalization has to come through legislation, not the courts.If the CARERS Act passes and marijuana is rescheduled, it would not allow use of the drug without a prescription. Cocaine and morphine are Schedule II drugs, and you could hardly call them legal under federal law. The bill is a half-step, but some states are taking two. The District of Columbia has legalized marijuana, even though Congress has thwarted its legitimate sale by refusing to collect any tax revenue from it. Maintaining marijuana regulation under the CSA keeps the national drug war churning while letting some states go with a wink and a nod to sovereignty that doesn\u2019t, legally speaking, exist. It\u2019s not so different from how police treat marijuana now, letting some people coast and cracking down on others.This raises another question of federal law: equal protection. The 14th Amendment provides for \u201cequal protection of the law\u201d to all citizens, and it\u2019s this provision that invalidated parochial state rules segregating schools and banning interracial marriage. The spirit of the amendment \u2014 ratified in the wake of the Civil War and a foundation of civil-rights-era legislation \u2014 is that states are not permitted to maintain their own race codes. When you map state marijuana laws against their black populations, there\u2019s a clear inversion. States where there are larger black minorities have been less likely to liberalize their marijuana laws, which fits with the generally racist character of the drug war. Where there are exceptions, it\u2019s not legalization but decriminalization, which gives the police discretion \u2014 never a recipe for equal protection. The way the law seems headed, federal and state governments will uphold a prohibition that criminalizes black citizens in an explicitly disproportionate manner.Constitutional law is above my pay grade, but the president has no such excuse. He must know this latest game plan is a cowardly abdication. Unlike gay marriage, the federal government has already decided to take the ball on marijuana: The Gonzales of Gonzales v. Raich was U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. It remains in the government\u2019s hands. If locking people up for a joint was a federal concern in 2005, then letting them go should be a federal concern in 2015. The Constitution should not be at the whim of political convenience. Equal protection is more than just the law; it\u2019s a national ideal, and caging someone in Georgia for a blunt while letting the packed bowl in Oregon slide is a violation of that spirit.",

    "President Barack Obama\u00a0defended a framework nuclear agreement with Iran as a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime opportunity\u201d to prevent development of a bomb and bring longer-term stability to the Middle East. He insisted the U.S. would stand by Israel if it were to come under attack, but acknowledged that his pursuit of diplomacy with Tehran has caused strain with the close ally.\u201cIt's been a hard period,\u201d Obama said in an interview with Thomas Friedman, a columnist for The New York Times published Sunday night. He added that it is \u201cpersonally difficult\u201d for him to hear his administration accused of not looking out for Israel's interests.Now in his seventh year in office, Obama cast the Iran talks as part of a broader foreign policy doctrine that sees American power as a safeguard that gives him the ability to take calculated risks.\u201cWe are powerful enough to be able to test these propositions without putting ourselves at risk,\u201d he said, citing his overtures to Cuba and Myanmar as other examples of his approach.The president's comments come days after the U.S. and other world powers reached a tentative agreement to curb Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. The framework cleared the way for negotiators to hammer out details ahead of a June 30 deadline for a final deal.Obama argued that successful negotiations presented the most effective way to keep Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, but insisted he would keep all options on the table if Tehran were to violate the terms.\u201cI've been very clear that Iran will not get a nuclear weapon on my watch, and I think they should understand that we mean it,\u201d\u00a0Obama said in the interview published Sunday. \u201cBut I say that hoping that we can conclude this diplomatic arrangement \u2014 and that it ushers a new era in U.S.-Iranian relations \u2014 and, just as importantly, over time, a new era in Iranian relations with its neighbors.\u201dThe president said there are many details that still need to be worked out with the Iranians and cautioned that there would be \u201creal political difficulties\u201d in implementing an agreement in both countries. He reiterated his opposition to a legislation that would give the U.S. Congress final say in approving or rejecting a deal, but said he hoped to find a path to allow Congress to \u201cexpress itself.\u201dOn the substance of the Iran framework agreement, Obama outlined how the U.S. would seek to verify that Tehran wasn't cheating. He said there would be an \u201cinternational mechanism\u201d that would assess whether there needed to be an inspection at a suspicious site and could overrule Iranian objections.The nuclear talks have been a remarkable shift in the frozen relationship between the U.S. and Iran. It has become normal for officials from both countries to communicate and hold face-to-face meetings. Obama is yet to meet with Iranian President Hasan Rouhani, though they did speak on the phone. He has also exchanged letters with Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Obama said the letters include \u201ca lot of reminders of what he perceives as past grievances against Iran.\u201d But he said the concessions Khamenei allowed his negotiators to make in the nuclear talks suggests that \u201che does realize that the sanctions regime that we put together was weakening Iran over the long term, and that if in fact he wanted to see Iran re-enter the community of nations, then there were going to have to be changes.\u201dThe White House plans an aggressive campaign to sell the deal to Congress, as well as to skeptical Arab allies who worry about Iran's destabilizing activity in the region. The president has invited leaders of six Gulf nations to Washington this spring and said he wanted to \u201cformalize\u201d U.S. assistance.Obama\u00a0said last week he would meet the leaders of the six\u00a0Gulf Cooperation Council\u00a0states this spring at his Camp David retreat, partly to discuss their concerns about the emerging nuclear agreement with\u00a0Iran.The GCC is Saudi Arabia,\u00a0Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates (UAE),\u00a0Qatar,\u00a0Oman\u00a0and\u00a0Bahrain.\u00a0Saudi Arabia, which sees\u00a0Iran\u00a0as its main regional rival, has repeatedly hinted that it would seek its own atomic weapons if\u00a0Tehran\u00a0ever did the same.Obama\u00a0said he wanted to discuss with the Gulf allies how to build more effective defense capabilities and assure them of U.S. support against outside attack. \u201cThat perhaps will ease some of their concerns and allow them to have a more fruitful conversation with the Iranians,\u201d he said.But the president said their biggest danger came not from a possible attack from\u00a0Iran\u00a0but from dissatisfaction inside their own countries, including from alienated, unemployed youth and a sense that there was no political outlet for grievances.So as well as giving military support, the\u00a0United States\u00a0must ask: \u201cHow can we strengthen the body politic in these countries, so that Sunni youth feel that they've got something other than (the Islamic State) to choose from,\u201d\u00a0Obama\u00a0said.Obama also said that the U.S. will make sure the deal does not threaten Israel's own military advantage.The notion that Iran is undeterrable is \u201csimply not the case,\u201d Obama told\u00a0The Times.\u201cAnd so for us to say, \u2018Let's try\u2019 \u2014 understanding that we're preserving all our options, that we're not naive \u2014 but if in fact we can resolve these issues diplomatically, we are more likely to be safe, more likely to be secure, in a better position to protect our allies.\u201dObama added that he was \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d to making sure Israel maintains \u201ctheir qualitative military edge\u201d and was willing to make clear that \u201cif Israel were to be attacked by any state, that we would stand by them.\u201dObama expressed concern about how the talks have strained US-Israel relations, indicating how he takes it personally when he's accused of being anti-Israel.\u201cPart of what has always made the US-Israeli relationship so special is that it has transcended party, and I think that has to be preserved. There has to be the ability for me to disagree with a policy on settlements, for example, without being viewed as ... opposing \u201dObama's comments came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged the U.S. on Sunday to seek a better deal to curb Iran's nuclear program and Senate Republicans pressed their demand that Congress be allowed to vote on the agreement.Netanyahu has been strongly critical of the deal struck on Thursday in Switzerland, saying it threatens the survival of Israel.In television appearances on Sunday, Netanyahu did not repeat his assertion made on Friday that any final agreement should include a commitment by Iran recognizing Israel's right to exist.But, speaking on CNN's\u00a0\u201cState of the Union\u201d he said of the deal, \u201cThis is not a partisan issue. This is not solely an Israeli issue. This is a world issue because everyone is going to be threatened by the pre-eminent terrorist state of our time, keeping the infrastructure to produce not one nuclear bomb but many, many nuclear bombs down the line.\u201dWire services",
    "One in 10 samples of breast milk purchased online is contaminated with cow's milk or formula, according to a study published on Monday in the journal Pediatrics.All but one contaminated sample included levels of cow's milk too high to be caused by inadvertent contamination, the study found, prompting the study\u2019s authors to conclude that some sellers are intentionally adding nonhuman milk to their product to increase output and boost profits.\"If a baby with cow's milk allergy were to drink this milk, it could be very harmful,\" lead author Sarah Keim, an assistant professor at the Ohio State University College of Medicine and a researcher at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Ohio, told Agence-France Presse.Out of 102 tested samples bought on commercial websites, 11 were found to contain bovine DNA. Ten of those samples contained cow's milk at a level that pointed to intentional adulteration.Cow\u2019s milk allergies or formula sensitivities could trigger dangerous reactions in babies drinking the contaminated milk, Keim\u00a0noted on 700\u2019s Children\u2019s, a blog featuring experts affiliated with Nationwide Children's Hospital's research institute.\u00a0Moreover, infants need certain nutrients that cow's\u00a0milk\u00a0does not provide. She noted that the presence of cow's milk is \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg,\u201d since there is no way of knowing \"what else is in milk purchased online.\"The market for breast milk in the United States has been steadily growing over the past few years, but the Food and Drug Administration does not regulate it. Fourteen nonprofit milk banks follow guidelines by the\u00a0Human Milk Banking Association of North America. A number of recent studies\u00a0have raised concerns\u00a0about the potential health consequences for babies who are fed human milk bought online.Keim\u2019s 2013\u00a0study\u00a0in Pediatrics\u00a0found that more than 75 percent of breast milk purchased online contained viral strains and disease-causing bacilli such as salmonella. Other samples included traces of medication that mothers were taking while pumping milk. In some cases, tests revealed that some suppliers were smokers despite claims that they weren\u2019t,\u00a0according to Keim. Dirty containers or pumping devices also are common sources of contamination.About 1 in 5 mothers in the U.S.\u00a0searches for milk online because their babies suffer from a medical condition, according\u00a0to a 2013 study published in Maternal and Child Health Journal,\u00a0and 16 percent do so because their infants cannot drink formula. Others need milk for an adopted child or because they are unable to breast-feed.The health concerns have prompted researchers to call for better standards and regulation for the gray market for breast milk, which is rapidly outgrowing its origin as an informal network of mothers sharing their milk with their friends' babies. In 2010 the FDA\u00a0warned\u00a0about\u00a0the risks of using milk from anyone other than the baby's mother.An editorial published in The British Medical Journal in March echoed those concerns. \"Although breast milk holds many known benefits, seeking out another\u2019s milk rather than turning to instant formula poses risks,\" it\u00a0read. \u201cAt present, milk bought\u00a0online\u00a0is a far from ideal alternative, exposing infants and other consumers to microbiological and chemical agents. Urgent action is required to make this market safer.\"Breast milk is also available through nonprofit milk banks, which procure donated milk used primarily by hospitals to feed infants who are born prematurely.With wire services",

    "A much-tweeted photo of Secretary of State John Kerry earlier this week showed him looking pensively out the window of his five-star hotel room in Lausanne, Switzerland.\u201cJohn, don\u2019t jump,\u201d wrote one Twitter humorist, reflecting concerns that Kerry might be despondent after days of hard bargaining with Iran and the other members of the so-called P5+1\u2014 the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia, and China.But on Thursday evening, after a negotiating session that literally went all night, Iranian and U.S. officials announced a historic framework for a long-term comprehensive nuclear agreement severely restricting Iran\u2019s ability to make nuclear weapons for more than a decade.After the gloom and doom of previous days, in which negotiators blew through a March 31 deadline for a political framework imposed by the Obama administration, Thursday\u2019s breakthrough seemed all the more sweet.Negotiators must still finalize the provisions of the deal by June 30, when an interim accord that has been twice extended expires. But there was much more detail released by Iranian and U.S. officials than had been anticipated, given Iran\u2019s reluctance to announce concessions in advance of completing an accord.The United States, not surprisingly, emphasized the restrictions on the Iranian program while Iran stressed relief of sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy and soured the mood of the long-suffering Iranian people.According to a fact sheet released by the White House, Iran has agreed to cut its installed centrifuges \u2014 the machines that spin and enrich uranium \u2014 by two-thirds from about 19,000 to about 6,000, of which only 5,060 will be allowed to operate for the next 10 years. Iran also agreed not to use more advanced centrifuge models for a decade. For 15 years, it will not enrich uranium beyond a low level and will restrict its stockpile of low-enriched uranium to 300 kilograms \u2014 not enough for a single weapon.The fact sheet did not say how Iran would do this \u2014 whether by sending its stockpile to another country or blending it into a less risky form.Iran also agreed not to enrich uranium at its facility at Fordow for 15 years, although the underground plant can be used for peaceful purposes such as making medical isotopes.The Iranians, according to the fact sheet, will shut off another potential pathway to a bomb by ripping out the core of a heavy water reactor under construction at Arak and replacing it with technology that yields a smaller amount of plutonium. Iran has promised to send out spent fuel from Arak and not to build a plant to reprocess it, effectively preventing Tehran from using the method to build weapons that North Korea employed when it quit the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 2003.The Iranians have also agreed to intrusive inspections including access to uranium mines and mills for 25 years, and to centrifuge production sites for 20 years. It accepted the Additional Protocol of the NPT \u2014 which allows for short-notice inspections \u2014 in perpetuity. These measures should make it difficult for Iran to sneak out and build a nuclear weapon covertly.It was left to Iran\u2019s U.S.-educated foreign minister, Javad Zarif, to lay out what Iran gets in return.Switching effortlessly from Farsi to English, Zarif told a horde of exhausted journalists in Switzerland that all previous United Nations Security Council resolutions condemning the Iranian program and imposing sanctions on Tehran would be lifted, along with European Union sanctions and U.S. so-called secondary sanctions that inhibit other countries from normal trade with Iran.The U.S. fact sheet said a new U.N. resolution would be passed that maintains restrictions on conventional arms transfers to Iran, including sanctions related to ballistic missiles.U.S. officials said sanctions relief would be phased in as Iran implements its part of the deal. Among the issues not discussed in detail on Thursday was how Iran would satisfy the international community\u2019s concerns about possible past military-related dimensions of its program, and how that might be tied to full sanctions relief.Zarif called the framework a win-win deal that had \u201cstopped a cycle that was not in the interest of anyone.\u201dPresident Barack Obama, speaking from the White House Rose Garden on a lovely spring afternoon, pronounced the framework \u201ca good deal\u201d that would make the world \u2014 including nervous U.S. allies in the Middle East \u2014 safer.Now both sides will have to convince critics inside and outside their countries that they are right. That will not be an easy task.Obama began the selling job with Saudi King Salman bin Abdul-Aziz, whom Obama called before speaking to the press \u2014 and, tellingly, before calling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or the Republican leaders of the U.S. Congress. Obama said he would invite all the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council to Camp David this spring to discuss how he can shore up their security.Administration officials said the U.S. would also reach out to Israel to address its concerns about Iran\u2019s destabilizing activities in the region.Netanyahu has infuriated Obama by campaigning relentlessly against what the Israeli leader has called a bad deal that threatens Israel\u2019s security.As for Congress, it is on a Passover-Easter break, giving the administration time to make its case to individual members before April 14, when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to vote on legislation that would give the House of Representatives and Senate the ability to block an Iran agreement. Obama promised on Thursday to brief Congress thoroughly on the details of the framework, but initial reaction from Republicans was skeptical.Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker said in a statement that the Obama administration should not \u201cbypass Congress and head straight to the U.N. Security Council,\u201d but should give Congress a chance to \u201cweigh in\u201d on a deal. \u201cIt is important that we wait to see the specific details of today\u2019s announcement, and as the P5-plus-one works toward any final deal, we must remain clear-eyed regarding Iran\u2019s continued resistance to concessions, long history of covert nuclear weapons-related activities, support of terrorism, and its current role in destabilizing the region,\u201d Corker said.Nuclear experts who have been skeptical of the negotiations sounded more positive on Thursday. Gary Samore, an expert at Harvard University\u2019s Belfer Center, told Al Jazeera that the framework was \u201cbetter than expected but still many important details [need] to be resolved, especially on the inspection and monitoring mechanisms.\u201dSamore said the framework achieves the administration\u2019s goal of preventing Iran from amassing enough fuel for a weapon for a year \u201cas long as the surplus low enriched uranium\" remains at 300 kilograms or below.\u00a0 He also noted that \u201cthe disposition of the surplus LEU (low-enriched uranium) is not specified in the framework,\u201d and said that would be \u201can important detail for the final agreement.\u201dPerhaps the most enthusiastic response came from ordinary Iranians who listened to Obama\u2019s comments broadcast live on local television: a first in a country that has been estranged from the U.S. since the 1979 Islamic revolution.Tehranis, who were celebrating the last day of their two-week New Year holiday, honked horns and sent each other congratulatory text messages including this one: \u201cThe winter is over.\u201d",

    "In a rare prisoner swap, a hard-line Syrian rebel group has released 25 women and children to Syrian government fighters in exchange for one of their captive commanders, a monitoring group said on Monday.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the 10 children and 15 women were kidnapped by the Sunni insurgents more than a year ago from two Shia-majority towns in northern Aleppo province.The deal was between the\u00a0Jaish al-Mujahideen faction, a self-described Islamist coalition that fights both the Syrian regime and the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), and pro-government militia, the Observatory said. Kurdish fighters known as Popular Protection Units (YPG) reportedly mediated the swap.The Observatory said the women and children were from Nubl and Zahra, two Shia villages that have been under a long siege by anti-government forces, including Jaish al-Mujahideen.\u201cThe women and children were kidnapped between a year and 18 months ago and held by different rebels,\u201d Observatory head Rami Abdulrahman told Reuters by phone. \u201cThey were handed to Jaish al-Mujahideen to use in an exchange.\u201dThe commander was the military leader of Jaish al-Mujahideen, who was captured in August, said Abdulrahman.Syrian state media have made no mention of the exchange, and government officials were not immediately available for comment.Kidnap for ransom is common in\u00a0Syria\u00a0but trades between opposing sides in the fighting are infrequent. More than 220,000 people\u00a0have been killed in Syria's conflict.Al Jazeera and Reuters",
    "FREETOWN, Sierra Leone \u2014 Haja Umu Jalloh has not left the room and cordoned-off porch for three weeks. She eats bowls of rice and sauce, slid underneath a nylon rope she cannot cross. She has lost her family \u2014 her parents, her aunt and uncle, her 1-year-old son. But the 17-year-old says defiantly, \"I feel happy because I am protecting others.\"Jalloh defends some 40 orphans at the St. George Foundation Interim Care Center from a terrifyingly invisible enemy, Ebola, which continues to ravage her country. Because of uncertainty about who, among a flood of children orphaned by Ebola, might carry the disease, she has been hired to stand guard just in case. She cares for every new arrival in the roped-off room. As an Ebola survivor, she is considered immune to the disease.This week she shares the room with four other girls. Three of them arrived at St. George after losing their primary caretakers to Ebola. The fourth was discovered alone in the woods outside Freetown, Sierra Leone\u2019s capital. In the past few months, several children entered the orphanage feeling fine, but they became feverish within a week. Ideally, their status would be assured before their arrival \u2014 but the management at St. George is no longer taking chances.",
    "Chicago\u2019s runoff election for mayor on Tuesday pits front-runner Mayor Rahm Emanuel against Cook County Commissioner Jes\u00fas \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia, with both candidates scrambling across town to convince voters that they should be at the helm of the Windy City.Emanuel and Garcia have visited schools, union halls and other standard campaign stops. But, as is so often case, both have ignored one voting bloc: the homeless.Chicago\u2019s has about 138,000 homeless individuals in its population of 2.7 million, according to the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless. While the homeless face obstacles to casting their ballots, many do vote, though estimates as to how many vote in Chicago are unavailable.William \u201cWillie\u201d Barnes, 64, is registered and plans to vote, one of the 10 percent of America\u2019s 1.6 million homeless people who do so every year, according to estimates by the National Coalition for the Homeless.Barnes lost his job as a truck driver several years ago and slipped into homelessness. He and his wife now live in a tent on the side of the Dan Ryan Expressway near Chicago\u2019s downtown. A blue and white \u201cBuild a better Chicago\u201d sign, the kind that appeared at public works projects after Emanuel became mayor in May 2011, props up their temporary shelter.He knows who he\u2019ll to vote for.\u201cI ain\u2019t got nothing to do but think, and I think about this a lot,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cI think I am going to vote for Emanuel. I know we are in rough times, and although we think it is rough, it can always get rougher. We need Emanuel because he\u2019s been in there already, he can handle the pressure.\u201dPolls suggest Chicago voters agree with Barnes and have cooled to Garcia since he managed to get enough votes to force a runoff. Emanuel would 58 percent of the vote compared to Garcia\u2019s 30 percent, according to a\u00a0Chicago Tribune poll.Mark Brown, a Chicago Sun-Times columnist who covers homelessness, said the homeless and near homeless, despite their numbers, haven\u2019t factored into candidates\u2019 strategies.\u201cI don\u2019t see any campaign in Chicago reaching out for the homeless vote,\u201d he said.In the 20th century, however, these voters played a key role in the once notoriously crooked Chicago political scene. The Democratic machine would pull the homeless to the polls with promises of money or alcohol, Brown said.Today, there\u2019s no evidence that the homeless vote early and often (as various Chicagoans are said to have quipped), but as recipients of public assistance and frequent targets of police harassment, the homeless have a stake in who runs their city\u2019s government.Emanuel's administration, for instance, has made deep cuts to\u00a0public mental health care, services that many living on the streets depend.As for what homeless voters feel, Brown said they share many concerns with the rest of the city but with \u201cperhaps a greater focus on crime and public health.\"Indeed, the homeless\u2019 understanding of politics echoes that of their fellow Chicagoans.Many in the city still resent Emanuel\u2019s shuttering of schools in 2013 to fill a budget gap. And community activists say the closings put children in crime-ridden neighborhoods at risk by forcing them to walk across streets controlled by rival gangs.Renard Parrish, 48, who sleeps most nights on Chicago's L train, told Al Jazeera in February that he resents Emanuel\u2019s school policy.\u201cI voted for Garcia, to tell you the truth. I think he has better ideas. I didn\u2019t see any need for those schools to be closed,\u201d Parrish said of his vote in the initial February election. \u201cThey were already talking about kids going to dangerous territory.\u201dStill, Parrish would like to see both candidates take a more direct role in the lives of the homeless.\u201cI hope we could have an advocate that will speak for us, come and help us get housing.\u201dIllinois\u2019\u00a0Homeless Bill of Rights\u00a0protects Barnes and Parrish\u2019s right to vote. Signed into law by then-Governor Pat Quinn in 2013, it allows homeless people with two forms of ID to list a homeless shelter as an address when registering. Barnes votes in the city\u2019s 11th Ward.\u201cSome states just make it harder to register to vote,\u201d although all U.S. citizens do have the right, said Ed Shurna, executive director of the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless.He said that survival is the top priority for most homeless who live day to day, not voting, although his organization does help the homeless register.While he said that Emanuel\u2019s administration has made some strides in helping homeless youth, Shurna doesn\u2019t see a stark contrast with Garcia on issues affecting the city\u2019s poorest.\u201cI don\u2019t have any sense if one candidate or the other is going to make any difference,\u201d Shurna added. Appealing to the homeless, he said, is not a priority for the candidates.\u201cI don\u2019t know of either candidate ever going to a big shelter saying, \u2018We\u2019ll make it easier to vote,\u2019\u201d he said.",
    "Victor Gotbaum, an influential New York labor leader who both fought City Hall and helped it survive its 1970s fiscal crisis, has died, his son said Monday. He was 93.Gotbaum died Sunday at his Manhattan home, Noah Gotbaum said. He said the cause of his father's death hasn't been determined.A New York Times report cited a heart attack as the cause of death.As the leader of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees' District Council 37 in New York, Gotbaum was the voice of the nation's biggest municipal union when the city faced the threat of bankruptcy in the mid-1970s.\"Victor Gotbaum was a true New York City warrior \u2014 a man of action who dedicated his life to organizing workers and improving their lives,\" but also understood the importance of compromise, Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement.In 1975, banks were hesitating to keep extending the city credit because of its big budget debt. Then-Mayor Abraham Beame called for laying off thousands of workers and canceling a planned 6 percent raise.Workers pushed back. Sanitation employees went on strike, and police officers protested by blocking the Brooklyn Bridge. But Gotbaum felt the workers had more to lose than to gain if their resistance ended with bankruptcy.\"My attitude was that we would all go down together if we didn't work this out,\" Gotbaum told District Council 37's Public Employee Press in a 2009 interview.So he worked with state and city officials to strike key compromises. The raise was deferred, and the unions used pension funds to buy city bonds. The city ultimately avoided bankruptcy.An intense labor advocate who didn't shy from strikes and sometimes pounded tables when making a point, Gotbaum led District Council 37 from 1965 through 1987. His tenure \"improved the lives of tens of thousands of city workers and their families\" and defended public services for all New Yorkers, current District Council 37 Executive Director Henry Garrido said.After getting a master's degree in international affairs from Columbia University, Gotbaum worked for the Department of Labor, helped set up a labor education program in Turkey and worked for a meat cutters' union and AFSCME in Chicago before returning to his native New York, according to his 2000 book, \"Negotiating in the Real World.\"\"From the beginning of my career as a labor leader, what I loved most were the negotiations,\" he wrote.While negotiating involved compromise, \"I don't think he ever compromised on issues he felt deeply about,\" Noah Gotbaum said. \"He was really on the side of the underdogs, always.\"Victor Gotbaum was involved in Democratic politics, and served as a New York state co-chairman of Michael Dukakis' 1988 presidential campaign. Gotbaum's widow, Betsy Gotbaum, was the city's elected public advocate from 2002 to 2010.The Associated Press",
    "Twitter has complied with Turkey's request to remove photographs of a prosecutor held at gunpoint by armed leftists, an official said Monday, and a ban on it ended hours after being imposed.YouTube, which authorities also banned after an Istanbul court ordered social media to remove any content showing the kidnapped prosecutor, remained blocked late on Monday as talks with it continued, the official said.Mehmet Selim Kiraz, the Istanbul prosecutor seen in the pictures, was later killed in a shoot-out between his hostage takers and police last week.\"Twitter has agreed to shut down accounts and remove images relating to last week's hostage-taking. The website will reopen to access very shortly,\" the senior official told Reuters before the site became accessible again.The micro-blogging site intends to appeal the Turkish court order, an official said without giving his name.Other social media sites were affected as well.\u00a0Facebook\u00a0said it had complied with a court order to restrict access to some content or face a block on its service. A company spokesman said it would appeal the order.Late on Monday, an Istanbul court ordered Google to remove controversial content on the prosecutor killed in hostage-taking incident, otherwise access to it would be blocked also.Ibrahim Kalin, a spokesman for President Tayyip Erdogan, said a prosecutor had demanded the bans because some media organizations had acted \"as if they were spreading terrorist propaganda\" in sharing the images of the hostage-taking.\"This has to do with the publishing of the prosecutor's picture. What happened in the aftermath is as grim as the incident itself,\" Kalin said. \"The demand from the prosecutor's office is that this image not be used anywhere in electronic platforms,\" he told a news conference in Ankara.Prosecutor Kiraz died from his wounds last Tuesday after security forces stormed the office where members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C) had taken him hostage. His two captors were also killed.The DHKP-C had published a picture of Kiraz with a gun to his head and said it would kill him unless its demands were met.\"The wife and children of prosecutor Kiraz have been deeply upset. The images are everywhere,\" the Turkish official said.Google said it was working to restore service to the YouTube video-sharing site, which it owns. Turkey's telecoms regulator could not immediately be reached and there was no statement on its website.Turkey\u00a0temporarily blocked Twitter and YouTube before local elections in March 2014, after audio recordings purportedly showing corruption in then-Prime Minister Erdogan's inner circle were leaked on their sites. That decision caused a public uproar and drew heavy international criticism.Turkey\u00a0filed over five times more content-removal requests to Twitter than any other country in the second half of 2014, data published in February by the micro-blogging site showed.Last year,\u00a0Turkey\u00a0tightened laws allowing sites to be blocked by the authorities more easily.Reuters",
    "The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) was already so deeply entrenched in Iraq\u2019s west that the towns of Fallujah and Ramadi were unable to vote in Iraq\u2019s spring 2014 national elections. At the time, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki still dismissed the group as a loose band of Al-Qaeda types with little reach beyond Anbar province. That all changed after June, when ISIL fighters\u00a0seized the northern city of Mosul\u00a0as Iraqi government forces abandoned the city \u2014 along with their uniforms and U.S. supplied weapons and munitions \u2014 without a fight.ISIL captured almost\u00a0$500 million in gold bullion\u00a0and cash in Mosul\u2019s central bank when it took control of Iraq\u2019s second city. There was also the added benefit of the city's strategic location as an oil hub where Syria, Iraq and Turkey intersect. Seizing and holding this territory, ISIL raised its black flag, declared\u00a0a new Islamic caliphate\u00a0and drew\u00a0thousands of volunteer fighters from around the world, many of whom were able to reach the group with relative ease via Turkey.Analysts expect the group to seek to consolidate its gains in the coming year, both in territory and in resources, and in the face of punishing airstrikes from a U.S.-led coalition\u00a0seeking to block and roll back its advances. Anti-ISIL forces are hoping that the promises of a more inclusive government by Iraq\u2019s new prime minister and plans for a national military draft will help alleviate Sunni disenchantment with a Shia-dominated government in Baghdad that has alienated them.ISIL has forged a violently sectarian order, targeting Christians and other minorities who refuse to convert or submit to paying religious taxes. In places where it can win over local populations, its governance can be less harsh and its fighters better placed to hold onto those towns.Having opted for a strategy of holding territory, the key to ISIL\u2019s survival is its ability to maintain order and governance in areas it has seized and to ensure the local economies keep working \u2014 to sustain ISIL\u2019s tax-and-extortion revenues, if nothing else. It has collected millions of dollars in ransom payments for foreign hostages and has also bootlegged captured oil. Some reports say that along with the fighters ISIL is keenly courting, it has also opened applications for engineers to work in its refineries for annual salaries starting at $200,000.ISIL is unlikely to try for more territory within Iraq, as Kurdish and Iraqi forces, bolstered by Iranian and U.S. support, are now pushing back and retaking key positions from ISIL fighters. Since the U.S. also began bombing Syrian towns, parts of that country may also be less hospitable for ISIL. The organization may only be able to expand there in partnership with local competitors such as the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front.While Western reaction to ISIL\u2019s beheading of hostages, the executions of captured enemy fighters, and the enslavement of women has been one of outrage, the response from the movement\u2019s target population has been the opposite. ISIL\u2019s social media presence and propaganda arm have allowed the group to spread its message and find support in even the most developed countries. Its ability to woo disaffected youth everywhere will only improve as more tech-savvy members clamor to its ranks.There are few places outside of the Iraq-Syria conflagration where an ISIL cell could take root, and the most likely candidate for 2015 would be Libya (although some Pakistani factions are also said to have pledged loyalty to the group). There are already Libyans working in the organization, there is enough anti-government unrest in Tripoli and beyond, and setting up a cell outside the Middle East would boost ISIL\u2019s recruitment and propaganda campaigns. In the meantime, lone-wolf actions \u2014 such as the\u00a0hostage taking at an Australian cafe\u00a0that ended with two hostages killed \u2014 by self-styled ISIL supporters will remain a low-key threat.ISIL has emerged and grown as a product of the weaknesses and failures of its enemies. Whether the coalition now formed against the group musters sufficient power to repair those weaknesses and roll back the extremists will be a major question in the coming year.",
    "The FBI is investigating whether hate crimes were committed during two St. Louis area attacks where suspects allegedly made reference to Ferguson, including the assault of former St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Curt Ford, investigators said Monday.Both attacks happened in March, one involving a white victim and black attackers, the other a black victim attacked by a white man. The suspects in both cases allegedly made references to Ferguson, the St. Louis suburb at the center of racial strife since a white police officer in August fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed.FBI spokeswoman Rebecca Wu said the agency is looking into both cases for possible hate crimes. Anyone found guilty of a federal hate crime involving bodily injury could face up to 10 years in prison.Investigators allege that Ford, 54, was punched by James Street at a convenience store on March 25 in Fenton. Police said Street, who is white, shouted racial slurs and told Ford, who is black, \"Go back to Ferguson.\" Ford, who played for the St. Louis Cardinals and Philadelphia Phillies from 1985 to 1990, said he was punched without warning.The 37-year-old Street is charged with third-degree assault motivated by discrimination. He is free on bond but doesn't have a listed phone number or an attorney.The other attack \u2014 captured on cellphone video posted on social media sites \u2014 happened March 23, on a MetroLink light rail train in St. Louis. The victim, a 45-year-old white man, told police he declined a young black man's request to use his cellphone before the young man asked what he thought about \"the Mike Brown situation.\" The victim answered that he hadn't given it much thought, and the young man repeatedly punched him.Ronald Williams, 20, who is black, was charged with a misdemeanor in the attack. Williams' attorney didn't return a message seeking comment. A juvenile also was attested in the attack.State hate-crime charges weren't sought in the light-rail attack because there wasn't enough evidence to prove that the attack involved racial or religious motivations, said Lauren Trager, spokeswoman for St. Louis Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce.The Associated Press",
    "Congressional scrutiny and approval of any nuclear agreement with Iran are essential and will help ensure the deal isn't a bad one, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said Sunday.Sen.

The bill requires the president to transmit, within five days of reaching a final deal, the text of the full agreement along with materials related to its implementation.With key elements still to be finalized, the framework agreement sealed by U.S.-led world powers describes a program for stunting Iran's capacity to produce nuclear weapons while giving Tehran quick access to assets and markets now blocked by international sanctions.In defending the framework and a potential final pact, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz cited what he called \u201cunprecedented access and transparency\u201d into Iran's nuclear activities that will allow the U.S. and its partner negotiators to know almost instantly should Iran try to evade the oversight.

    "Saudi\u00a0Arabia\u00a0has asked\u00a0Pakistan\u00a0for military aircraft, warships and soldiers, Pakistani Defense Minister Khawaja Asif said on Monday, at the start of a parliamentary debate on whether\u00a0Pakistan\u00a0should get involved in a Saudi-led campaign in\u00a0Yemen.Saudi Arabia, the Gulf's main Sunni Muslim power, has asked Sunni-majority Pakistan to\u00a0join the military coalition that began conducting air strikes in Yemen last month against rebel Houthi forces, who adhere the Zaidi school of Shia Islam and whom Gulf countries see as an regional proxy for Shia Iran.Asif has in turn hedged his bets. He has said repeatedly he will defend any threat to Saudi Arabia's \u201cterritorial integrity\u201d without defining what action Pakistan might take in practice.\u201cBoth\u00a0Pakistan\u00a0and Turkey are concerned at the overthrow of a legitimate government of Yemen\u00a0by use of force by non-state actors ...\u00a0Pakistan\u00a0and Turkey agreed that the continuing crisis in\u00a0Yemen\u00a0could plunge the region into turmoil.\u201dThe Saudi-led and U.S. supported military campaign entered its 12th day Monday, targeting the Houthi rebels who took over the capital, Sanaa, in September and eventually\u00a0forced Yemeni President Abd Rabbu\u00a0Mansour Hadi to flee. The rebels and allied forces are now making a push for Yemen's second-largest city, Aden, declared a temporary capital by Hadi before he fled abroad.The Saudi-led force also has blockaded Yemen by air and sea. Humanitarian groups, along with Russia at the United Nations Security Council, have called for a pause in the fighting to allow for aid to reach Yemen amid dwindling medical supplies and overstretched personnel. The Red Cross subsequently said on Monday that it was given permission to land planes full of staff and supplies into the country, but those deliveries were still being held up by \u201clogistical problems.\u201dEvacuations of foreign nationals also continued. India said nearly all of its citizens in Yemen would be evacuated by Monday night. As of Sunday, India had evacuated nearly 2,300 citizens, most by sea from Aden. It was unclear how many more were left.The current Pakistani government may feel an obligation to help the war effort because of past Saudi patronage. Last year, Riyadh gave\u00a0Pakistan\u00a0$1.5 billion in aid money, while it also sheltered current Pakistani President Nawaz Sharif after he was overthrown in a 1999 military coup during a previous stint in charge of the country.But joining the Saudi-led coalition could inflame a sectarian conflict at home where about a fifth of the population is Shia and attacks on Shia are increasing, further destabilizing the nuclear-armed nation of 180 million people. The Pakistani army, a mix of both Shia and Sunni generals, risks compromising its non-sectarian position by\u00a0becoming overtly involved in the conflict\u00a0and supporting the Saudis against the Houthis.Pakistani intervention would probably also anger Shia power\u00a0Iran, with which Pakistan shares a long and porous border in a region roiling with its own separatist insurgency. Pakistan's other main borders are with archenemy\u00a0India\u00a0and Afghanistan, where\u00a0Pakistani troops are conducting operations against the Taliban, which has long terrorized the country's Shia minority. The Iranian foreign minister will visit\u00a0Pakistan\u00a0this week.Many analysts say the military, which has ruled\u00a0Pakistan\u00a0for more than half its existence since independence, has the final call. The generals have been silent.Pakistan\u00a0has nearly 1.5 million active soldiers and reserves, but about a third of those are tied up with operations along the Afghan border. The bulk of the remaining forces face off with nuclear-armed\u00a0India. Others are executing the government's new counter-terrorism plan.Even though\u00a0Saudi Arabia\u00a0is a \u201cspecial friend\u201d of both the government and the military, Pakistani intervention in\u00a0Yemen\u00a0might be unwise, said retired Maj. Gen. Mahmud Ali Durrani, a former national security adviser.\"If it was to defend\u00a0Saudi Arabia\u00a0against aggression, in spite of our commitments, I think we would stretch to sending troops,\" he said. \"To send our troops to a third country \u2014 I think that would be foolhardy.\"Al Jazeera and wire services",

    "I was born Lew Alcindor. Now I\u2019m Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.The transition from Lew to Kareem was not merely a change in celebrity brand name \u2014 like Sean Combs to Puff Daddy to Diddy to P. Diddy \u2014 but a transformation of heart, mind and soul. I used to be Lew Alcindor, the pale reflection of what white America expected of me. Now I\u2019m Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the manifestation of my African history, culture and beliefs.For most people, converting from one religion to another is a private matter requiring intense scrutiny of one\u2019s conscience. But when you\u2019re famous, it becomes a public spectacle for one and all to debate. And when you convert to an unfamiliar or unpopular religion, it invites criticism of one\u2019s intelligence, patriotism and sanity. I should know. Even though I became a Muslim more than 40 years ago, I\u2019m still defending that choice.I was introduced to Islam while I was a freshman at UCLA. Although I had already achieved a certain degree of national fame as a basketball player, I tried hard to keep my personal life private. Celebrity made me nervous and uncomfortable. I was still young, so I couldn\u2019t really articulate why I felt so shy of the spotlight. Over the next few years, I started to understand it better.Part of my restraint was the feeling that the person the public was celebrating wasn\u2019t the real me. Not only did I have the usual teenage angst of becoming a man, but I was also playing for one of the best college basketball teams in the country and trying to maintain my studies. Add to that the weight of being black in America in 1966 and \u201967, when James Meredith was ambushed while marching through Mississippi, the Black Panther Party was founded, Thurgood Marshall was appointed as the first African-American Supreme Court Justice and a race riot in Detroit left 43 dead, 1,189 injured and more than 2,000 buildings destroyed.I came to realize that the Lew Alcindor everyone was cheering wasn\u2019t really the person they imagined. They wanted me to be the clean-cut example of racial equality. The poster boy for how anybody from any background \u2014 regardless of race, religion or economic standing \u2014 could achieve the American dream. To them, I was the living proof that racism was a myth.I knew better. Being 7-foot-2 and athletic got me there, not a level playing field of equal opportunity. But I was also fighting a strict upbringing of trying to please those in authority. My father was a cop with a set of rules, I attended a Catholic school with priests and nuns with more rules, and I played basketball for coaches who had even more rules. Rebellion was not an option.Still, I was discontented. Growing up in the 1960s, I wasn\u2019t exposed to many black role models. I admired Martin Luther King Jr. for his selfless courage and Shaft for kicking ass and getting the girl. Otherwise, the white public\u2019s consensus seemed to be that blacks weren\u2019t much good. They were either needy downtrodden folks who required white people\u2019s help to get the rights they were due or radical troublemakers wanting to take away white homes and jobs and daughters. The \u201cgood ones\u201d were happy entertainers, either in show business or sports, who were expected to show gratitude for their good fortune. I knew this reality was somehow wrong \u2014 that something had to change. I just didn\u2019t know what it meant for me.Much of my early awakening came from reading \u201cThe Autobiography of Malcolm X\u201d as a freshman. I was riveted by Malcolm\u2019s story of how he came to realize that he was the victim of institutional racism that had imprisoned him long before he landed in an actual prison. That\u2019s exactly how I felt: imprisoned by an image of who I was supposed to be. The first thing he did was push aside the Baptist religion that his parents had brought him up in and study Islam. To him, Christianity was a foundation of the white culture responsible for enslaving blacks and supporting the racism that permeated society. His family was attacked by the Christianity-spouting Ku Klux Klan, and his home was burned by the KKK splinter group the Black Legion.Malcolm X\u2019s transformation from petty criminal to political leader inspired me to look more closely at my upbringing and forced me to think more deeply about my identity. Islam helped him find his true self and gave him the strength not only to face hostility from both blacks and whites but also to fight for social justice. I began to study the Quran.This decision set me on an irreversible course to spiritual fulfillment. But it definitely wasn\u2019t a smooth course. I made serious mistakes along the way. Then again, maybe the path isn\u2019t supposed to be smooth; maybe it\u2019s supposed to be filled with obstacles and detours and false discoveries in order to challenge and hone one\u2019s beliefs. As Malcolm X said, \u201cI guess a man\u2019s entitled to make a fool of himself if he\u2019s ready to pay the cost.\u201dI paid the cost.As I said earlier, I was brought up to respect rules \u2014 and especially those who enforced the rules, such as teachers, preachers and coaches. I\u2019d always been an exceptional student, so when I wanted to know more about Islam, I found a teacher in Hammas Abdul-Khaalis. During my years playing with the Milwaukee Bucks, Hammas\u2019 version of Islam was a joyous revelation. Then in 1971, when I was 24, I converted to Islam and became Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (meaning \u201cthe noble one, servant of the Almighty\u201d).The question I\u2019m often asked is why I had to pick a religion so foreign to American culture and a name that was hard for people to pronounce. Some fans took it very personally, as if I had firebombed their church while tearing up an American flag. Actually, I was rejecting the religion that was foreign to my American culture and embracing one that was part of my black African heritage. (An estimated 15 to 30 percent of slaves brought from Africa were Muslims.) Fans thought I joined the Nation of Islam, an American Islamic movement founded in Detroit in 1930. Although I was greatly influenced by Malcolm X, a leader in the Nation of Islam, I chose not to join because I wanted to focus more on the spiritual rather than political aspects. Eventually, Malcolm rejected the group right before three of its members assassinated him.My parents were not pleased by my conversion. Though they weren\u2019t strict Catholics, they had raised me to believe in Christianity as the gospel. But the more I studied history, the more disillusioned I became with the role of Christianity in subjugating my people. I knew, of course, that the Second Vatican Council in 1965 declared slavery an \u201cinfamy\u201d that dishonored God and was a poison to society. But for me, it was too little, too late. The failure of the church to use its might and influence to stop slavery and instead to justify it as somehow connected to original sin made me angry. Papal bulls (e.g., \u201cDum Diversas\u201d and \u201cRomanus Pontifex\u201d) condoned enslaving native people and stealing their lands.And while I realize that many Christians risked their lives and families to fight slavery and that it would not have been ended without them, I found it hard to align myself with the cultural institutions that had turned a blind eye to such outrageous behavior in direct violation of their most sacred beliefs.The adoption of a new name was an extension of my rejection of all things in my life that related to the enslavement of my family and people. Alcindor was a French planter in the West Indies who owned my ancestors. My forebears were Yoruba people, from present day Nigeria. Keeping the name of my family\u2019s slave master seemed somehow to dishonor them. His name felt like a branded scar of shame.My devotion to Islam was absolute. I even agreed to marry a woman whom Hammas suggested for me, despite my strong feelings for another woman. Ever the team player, I did as \u201cCoach\u201d Hammas recommended. I also followed his advice not to invite my parents to the wedding \u2014 a mistake that took me more than a decade to rectify. Although I had my doubts about some of Hammas\u2019 instruction, I rationalized them away because of the great spiritual fulfillment I was experiencing.But my independent spirit finally emerged. Not content to receive all my religious knowledge from one man, I pursued my own studies. I soon found that I disagreed with some of Hammas\u2019 teachings about the Quran, and we parted ways. In 1973, I traveled to Libya and Saudi Arabia to learn enough Arabic to study the Quran on my own. I emerged from this pilgrimage with my beliefs clarified and my faith renewed.From that year to this, I have never wavered or regretted my decision to convert to Islam. When I look back, I wish I could have done it in a more private way, without all the publicity and fuss that followed. But at the time I was adding my voice to the civil rights movement by denouncing the legacy of slavery and the religious institutions that had supported it. That made it more political than I had intended and distracted from what was, for me, a much more personal journey.Many people are born into their religion. For them it is mostly a matter of legacy and convenience. Their belief is based on faith, not just in the teachings of the religion but also in the acceptance of that religion from their family and culture. For the person who converts, it is a matter of fierce conviction and defiance. Our belief is based on a combination of faith and logic because we need a powerful reason to abandon the traditions of our families and community to embrace beliefs foreign to both. Conversion is a risky business because it can result in losing family, friends and community support.Some fans still call me Lew, then seem annoyed when I ignore them. They don\u2019t understand that their lack of respect for my spiritual choice is insulting. It\u2019s as if they see me as a toy action figure, existing solely to decorate their world as they see fit, rather than as an individual with his own life.Kermit the Frog famously complained, \u201cIt\u2019s not easy being green.\u201d Try being Muslim in America. According to a Pew Research Center poll on attitudes about major religious groups, the U.S. public has the least regard for Muslims \u2014 slightly less than it has for atheists \u2014 even though Islam is the third-largest faith in America. The acts of aggression, terrorism and inhumanity committed by those claiming to be Muslims have made the rest of the world afraid of us. Without really knowing the peaceful practices of most of the world\u2019s 1.6 billion Muslims, they see only the worst examples. Part of my conversion to Islam is accepting the responsibility to teach others about my religion, not to convert them but to co-exist with them through mutual respect, support and peace. One world does not have to mean one religion, just one belief in living in peace.",

    "According to the National Citizen Femicide Observatory, a coalition of 43 groups that document the crime, six women are assassinated every day.Yet only 24 percent of the 3,892 femicides the group identified in 2012 and 2013 were investigated by authorities. And only 1.6 percent led to sentencing.\u201cFemicides are a pandemic in Mexico,\u201d asserts Ana G\u00fcezmes, the local representative of United Nations Women, the agency devoted to gender issues.The word \"feminicidio\" first entered the vernacular in the 1990s, with explosive rates of disappearances and murders of women in the border town of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. In fact, more women have been killed in the state of Mexico, which surrounds the capital city of the same name. The number doubled from 2005 to 2011, when the current national president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, was governor of the state. Today he has pledged to combat drug violence overall but has not spoken out against femicides.Impunity is the main motor of the gender crime, G\u00fcezmes says, as well as social norms that allow the violence to be ignored or accepted as a normal part of life. She describes femicides as the extreme end of a society where 63 percent of women have suffered abuse by male hands. She estimates that maybe a third or half of the cases involved sexual partners. The balance \u2014 abductions, rapes and  discarding the bodies like garbage \u2014 are probably linked to the generalized drug violence that is tearing Mexico apart.G\u00fcezmes says the government needs to put more effort toward prevention, and improve access to justice. \u201cThese are the biggest problems.\u201dTo counter the lack of reliable government statistics, the Observatory trawls through press clips and conducts interviews door-to-door in marginalized neighborhoods, like this one on the edge of the capital city, where cases normally take place.The group issues regular reports and provides pro bono lawyers to relatives seeking to prosecute killers. They also erect pink crosses at death scenes, but these rarely last more than a day before unidentified men take them down.Most of these cases get lost in Mexico\u2019s dysfunctional justice system, where police officers can\u2019t be bothered to probe, or claim it\u2019s the woman\u2019s fault, or can be bought off by criminal gangs, says Maria de la Luz Estrada, head of the group. When the murders are investigated, incompetence and failure to follow due process often allow murderers to escape punishment.Activists say the distinction of femicide in the law is important, because the sexual nature distinguishes the killings from ordinary homicide.\u201cHate is what marks these crimes. The bodies show 20 or 30 blows,\u201d de la Luz says. \u201cThey slice off breasts and faces and throw the fragments in the garbage. In a macho society like Mexico, authorities are always questioning what the women did. What was she wearing? Was she sexually active? This helps the impunity and lack of action.\u201dThe victims are generally vulnerable young women, impoverished single mothers or teens. Attackers frequently seize victims on empty streets as they leave school or work, force them into cars, and then rape and torture them and dispose of the bodies.Families in poor areas like this one generally lack the money or clout to seek legal action, says de la Luz. \u201cThe parents are scared to give photos and details to the police, because that can make them vulnerable to extortionists, who say, \u2018We have her,\u2019 when in fact they don\u2019t. Corrupt authorities often say, \u2018If you speak out, your case won\u2019t advance.\u2019\u201dSu\u00e1rez Padilla is one of the few parents who have pressed charges, but he has had to confront misogynist cops, who implied that his daughter was responsible for her own death because her cell phone contained 200 nude photos taken by the killer.He takes solace in the international pressure that convinced Mexican lawmakers in 2007 to approve new laws aimed at preventing violence against women. The law called for a data bank and gender violence alerts, to encourage national, state and local governments to catch perpetrators and prevent murders. Yet neither has been activated effectively.The special prosecutor for violent crimes against women, Nelly Montealegre Diaz, admits that no femicides were prosecuted in 2014. She blames impunity and corruption, but says the government is addressing the problem in a gradual overhaul of the legal system.Harder to combat, she says, is social acceptance of gender violence. \u201cIf a worker sees a [female] colleague with a black eye or the father hitting the mother, they think it is normal. Women are seen as objects.\u201d",
    "Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan is seeking a second term in 2015. A month ago, his prospects looked good, despite a first term marked by policy miscues, a plodding style, an uninspiring personality and an inability \u2014 or sheer reluctance \u2014 to take on corruption, Nigeria\u2019s chief malady.On April 14, Boko Haram, a Nigerian Islamist group that rejects the country\u2019s alleged Western orientation in education and values, launched one of the gravest challenges yet in its increasingly bloody push to make Africa\u2019s most populous nation an Islamic state. In one gruesome episode, the insurgents set off car bombs in Nyanya, a crowded transport hub in Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s capital. Officials put the death toll at 75; eyewitnesses said at least 200 people were killed.The next day, Boko Haram staged an audacious midnight abduction of more than 200 high school girls from their dormitories in Chibok, an otherwise quiescent community in Nigeria\u2019s northeastern state of Borno, the group\u2019s bloodiest staging post.Jonathan\u2019s deplorable handling of the abduction crisis will undoubtedly define his presidency \u2014 and may imperil his bid for re-election. For two weeks, he did not do anything about the bloodletting and abductions. Instead, he held a campaign-style event in Kano, where he mocked his political opponents. That outing suggested an alienated leader who was not aware of the deep anxiety that has gripped his country.Trading insults with his political rivals hours after terrorists slaughtered scores of innocent Nigerians was insensitive enough. Failing to respond to the abduction of schoolgirls compounded the portrait of a coldly indifferent president.Jonathan\u2019s apathy couldn\u2019t come at a worse time. Riveted by the dreadful abductions of teenage girls, the international media turned their spotlight on Nigeria. Two weeks after the kidnappings, he had not addressed the country. Officials gave conflicting answers about the number of abducted students. His security aides and military commanders even misled the public by claiming the girls had been rescued. The lack of a clear strategy for tracking the abductors was stunning. The president\u2019s tardy attempt to set up a committee to deal with the rescue effort was too little, too late.When he finally commented on the ongoing crisis, after local and international uproar, Jonathan\u2019s assurances about finding and rescuing the abducted children was tepid and unconvincing. Meanwhile, his sympathizers speculated on social media that his opponents manufactured the abduction crisis to depict him as ineffectual and hurt his re-election chances. On Monday in a new video obtained by Agence France-Presse, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau claimed the abducted girls had been \u201cliberated\u201d \u2014 converted to Islam \u2014 and would be released only if Nigeria freed the group\u2019s imprisoned members. In the communications war, if not in reality, Shekau clearly had the upper hand.Jonathan has had a mediocre run as president, but perhaps it was to be expected. He is hardly an exception in this regard. With few exceptions, Nigeria has been unfortunate in the area of leadership. As with many of his predecessors, he had little or no preparation to occupy the highest office in the country. He had not articulated a vision to pursue as president. After a few years of holding teaching posts at the University of Port Harcourt in Rivers state, he was appointed as a governor in December 2005 after the impeachment of the then-governor, DSP Alamieyeseigha. In 2006 the ruling People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) picked him as a vice presidential candidate on a ticket with Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, former President Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s successor. Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s untimely death in 2010 catapulted Jonathan to the presidency.Despite his ill preparation, there were personal and historical reasons that could have compelled Jonathan to rise beyond his limitations and leave a positive mark on Nigeria\u2019s troubled political landscape. During the 2011 presidential campaign, he made much capital out of his deep childhood poverty, often stating that his parents could not afford to buy him shoes. For a nation where 70 percent of the population lives in dire poverty, his antecedents inspired hopes that, as president, he would become a passionate advocate for the poor, attuning his policies to alleviate the plight of the country\u2019s most wretched. More important, he comes from the country\u2019s oil-rich but economically depressed Niger Delta. Many dared to hope that he would embark on much-needed infrastructural development in his natal region and the rest of Nigeria.The president\u2019s supporters insist that his mediocrity owes less to inherent poverty of vision than the design of his implacable political foes, sworn to derail him. They allege that he has been hampered by his enemies\u2019 inciting violence, especially in the northeast. They allege that northern politicians \u2014 aggrieved that Jonathan, who is a Christian and a southerner, has usurped their turn at the presidency \u2014 are sponsoring much of the terrorist attacks. Jonathan may well be a victim of northern political forces determined to frustrate him. But he has not displayed any ingenuity in devising a counteroffensive. Despite the considerable power that resides in the Nigerian presidency, he has not been able to defeat or neutralize his political opponents.In Nigeria elections are decided by access to cash, by the ability to rig the vote and by control of the state machinery \u2014 the military, police and secret agents. The president holds clear advantages in those areas. Perhaps Jonathan\u2019s greatest advantage is the weakness of the main opposition party, the All Progressives Alliance (APC). The party has been content to attack the incumbent without offering any substantive policy alternatives. What\u2019s more, many of the APC\u2019s prominent members are former top PDP officials who left the party after losing out in power tussles. For many Nigerians, the PDP and the APC are ideologically indistinguishable. In fact, many Nigerians would argue that the APC is, in fact, only a disenchanted faction of the PDP.Jonathan may have undermined his electoral prospects by allowing Boko Haram to prove that he has few ideas for combating the scourge of violence ravaging the country. But more important, the episode has exposed the chronic inability of Nigeria\u2019s politicians to govern competently \u2014 a sin for which Jonathan isn\u2019t solely to blame.",
    "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Speaking to a packed crowd of supporters on Monday evening, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said he was still mulling entering the 2016 presidential contest, but would only do so if he thought he could \u201cput together millions of people who are prepared to work really hard to take on the big-money interests.\"Sanders has openly discussed his potential candidacy for months, and even paid a visit to the crucial primary state of Iowa earlier this year. But in recent weeks he has begun to sound more reluctant about jumping into the race, in large part because of doubts over whether he could raise the money necessary to run a credible campaign. During Monday\u2019s speaking event, Sanders indicated that he was concerned a poor showing would undermine political support for left-wing economic policies.\u201cIt has to be done well,\u201d the Senate\u2019s one self-identified democratic socialist said during a public event at San Francisco's Commonwealth Club, the oldest public-affairs forum in the United States. \u201cBecause if it\u2019s not done well, then people will say, \u2018Oh, income and wealth inequality: If you didn\u2019t do very well in your campaign, then no one believes in that.\u2019\"But if the senator is leaning against running, he gave no indication on Monday. Instead he turned the question on the audience, asking how many people in the crowd wanted him to run for president and would be willing to volunteer for his campaign if he did.\u201cAre people of the belief that we really cannot defeat these guys because they\u2019re so powerful?\u201d he asked, referring to the billionaires who he says he would be running to oppose. \u201cOr in fact is there enough hope left in America to bring out people together to fight for a different country?\"When people in the audience began to applaud in response, he waved it off. \u201cNo, it was a question, not a comment,\u201d he said.The audience \u2014 mostly residents of one of the most liberal regions of the country \u2014 seemed overwhelmingly supportive of a presidential bid. When Sanders asked again near the end of the event how many people in the audience believe he should run for president, he received nearly unanimous applause.If doubts about his ability to raise money are the main thing giving Sanders pause, then California\u2019s Bay Area is an ideal place to put those doubts to the test. The region is a hot spot for Democratic political fundraising. Hillary Clinton, the presumptive frontrunner in the Democratic primary, made a recent appearance in nearby Silicon Valley and is expected to make a few more in April.Much of the rest of Sanders\u2019s appearance was dedicated to his key policy themes: Rising inequality, stagnating wages, public investment, and the people who he jokingly referred to as \u201cmy good friends on Wall Street.\"In response to one question about financial regulation, Sanders endorsed \u201ca fee on Wall Street speculation\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to the idea of a financial transaction tax \u2014 and urged government action to \u201cbreak up\u201d the large financial institutions that are considered \u201ctoo big to fail.\"\u201cNow having said that, David,\u201d he said, addressing moderator David Campos, a member of San Francisco\u2019s Board of Supervisors, \u201cdo you think I\u2019m going to get many campaign contributions?\"",
    "Earlier this month a 19-year-old and a 20-year-old were expelled from the University of Oklahoma over their so-called leadership role in a racist frat chant that went viral. Protesters picketed outside one former student\u2019s home, which the family temporarily fled because of threats.The same day, the University of Maryland announced it was launching an investigation of an email containing racist and misogynistic language sent to a campus fraternity by one of its members. Puzzlingly, the email was sent in January 2014. It\u2019s not clear how it came to light this year. The author of the email was suspended from his frat. University President Wallace D. Loh vowed on Twitter to \u201censure due process and protect the free speech guaranteed by our Constitution,\u201d adding that he is \u201cstruggling with justifying this email as free speech.\u201dA teacher at a private Catholic school in New Jersey came under fire three week ago for posting a homophobic rant on Facebook.

These actions didn\u2019t prevent Susan Sarandon and Greg Bennett, a former \u201cReal Housewives of New Jersey\u201d cast member, from denouncing her on social media \u2014 a medium in which Sarandon and Bennett wield considerably more power than a random schoolteacher. The teacher has since been placed on administrative leave, and her family has embarked on a fundraising campaign to cover costs incurred by her loss of income.I abhor racist, misogynistic and homophobic remarks as much as the next progressive. They\u2019re crude, obnoxious and ignorant. But do they really warrant suspension, expulsion or potential job loss?My compassion for the New Jersey schoolteacher is limited. She is an adult with a career; she should have known better than to write something stupid and hurtful in what is essentially a public forum. However, given the lack of evidence that her bigotry extended to the classroom, I\u2019m not convinced she deserves to be suspended or fired.As for the recent trend of college-age men being punished for poor judgment, I find that far more sinister.In my early 20s, I said and wrote many things that could be construed as offensive. I also have male friends I knew when they were 20 and foolish. I believe there is a wide and meaningful gap between chanting \u201cNo means yes! Yes means anal!\u201d (a Yale fraternity chant that was recorded in 2010, leading to the frat\u2019s five-year suspension from campus) and actually raping a woman. At 20, most people want to impress their friends \u2014 and most rapists don\u2019t need a chant to get in the mood.Jon Ronson wrote a fascinating piece for The New York Times Magazine in February, \u201cHow one stupid tweet blew up Justine Sacco\u2019s life.\u201d (He has also just published a book, \u201cSo You\u2019ve Been Publicly Shamed.\u201d) His thesis is that the rise of social media has ushered in a new era of public shaming, a punishment that, according to him, was once deemed \u201ctoo brutal\u201d to be carried out in the U.S. and Britain.Publicly \u2014 and, thanks to the Internet, permanently \u2014 shaming young people whose brains aren\u2019t fully developed, expelling them from college and picketing outside their families\u2019 homes do not further the cause of justice. This is the kind of petty nonsense the great civil rights strategists of an earlier era wouldn\u2019t have spent 10 minutes on. As the Trinidadian-American activist Kwame Ture (formerly known as Stokely Carmichael) and political scientist Charles V. Hamilton wrote in \u201cBlack Power: The Politics of Liberation,\u201d invoking an example far worse than a racist song:When white terrorists bomb a black church and kill five black children, that is an act of individual racism, widely deplored by most segments of the society. But when in that same city \u2014 Birmingham, Alabama \u2014 500 black babies die each year because of the lack of proper food, shelter and medical facilities and thousands more are destroyed and maimed physically, emotionally and intellectually because of conditions of poverty and discrimination ... that is a function of institutional racism.They weren\u2019t saying that individual racism isn\u2019t bad or wrong; merely that it doesn\u2019t require towering moral courage or steely intestinal fortitude to condemn it. In other words, anyone with an Internet connection can tweet-shame a dumb fratboy. But it takes real leadership and organizational skills to take on institutionalized racism.It\u2019s emotionally satisfying to make a few scapegoats the focal point of our collective rage over continued inequality. But getting someone fired, kicked out of school or permanently branded a bigot on the basis of an ill-advised email, Facebook comment or 30-second chant, however crass or brutal, solves nothing. It harms individuals, not the roots of oppression. At best it\u2019s a waste of time and energy; at worst, it\u2019s a violation of constitutional rights.Words hurt. They have power. Sometimes \u2014 for example, when a woman is alone at night, a boss is alone with an employee or a black man is alone with a police officer \u2014 they constitute an implicit threat. Those circumstances do not apply in these cases. Feeling hurt, angry, uncomfortable or annoyed is not the same as being threatened. Hearing a rape joke is not the same as being attacked.It\u2019s time to redirect all this righteous anger at the real enemies of progress. Who cares what some ignorant teenager said in a country in which megawealthy corporations systematically maltreat workers? Who cares about chanting fratboys when politicians are stripping away women\u2019s right to choose? Who cares about a racist song when cops are getting away with murder?",

    "The SBC has been wrestling with its ugly racial past for at least 20 years. In 1995 it passed a resolution on racial reconciliation that set out to \u201clament and repudiate\u201d its roles in slavery and the civil rights movement. (The longtime ERLC president behind that document, Richard Land, was nudged into announcing his retirement in 2012 after making intemperate public remarks about the Trayvon Martin case. Land was in the audience at the conference last week, but he did not speak publicly.) Also in 2012 the SBC elected its first black president, a Louisiana pastor, Fred Luter, whose speech at last week\u2019s conference compared racism to more traditional scourges of adultery, pornography and abortion.Moore, a white native of Mississippi, has become an outspoken advocate on racial issues since he took over from Land two years ago. He has spoken often about his goal to integrate his denomination\u2019s 50,000 congregations. And after the grand jury decision in the Garner case, he quickly responded online, writing that \u201ca government that can choke a man to death on video for selling cigarettes is not a government living up to a biblical definition of justice or any recognizable definition of justice.\u201d Moore told reporters on Friday, \u201cOne of the good things in a very bad year when it comes to racial tensions in America is there have been more conversations among Christians thinking these things through.\u201dConservative evangelicals, however, made previous attempts at thinking these things through, starting in earnest in the 1990s. Confessing his previous neglect of the issue, evangelist Billy Graham, whose larger-than-life bronze statue looms on Southern Baptist property just up the street from headquarters, wrote in 1993 that \u201cracial and ethnic hostility is the foremost social problem facing our world today.\u201d (Then again, his son Franklin Graham recently drew condemnation for his comment that most police shootings could be avoided if \u201cblacks, whites, Latinos and everybody else\u201d would simply obey and respect the police.)It\u2019s telling, meanwhile, that the term \u201cracial reconciliation\u201d is generally favored over \u201cracial justice\u201d in white evangelical circles. \u201cBy \u2018racial reconciliation,\u2019 they typically mean getting along at an interpersonal level, making friends, getting to know each other and perhaps worshiping together,\u201d Michael Emerson, a sociologist at Rice University, said by email last week. \u201cOverall, it continues to not mean racial justice, changes in laws or any other structural alterations.\u201d",
    "It didn\u2019t take long for battle lines to be drawn when Indiana Gov. Mike Pence signed his state\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) into law late last week. Proponents of the bill insisted that it simply offers additional protections to religious people practicing their faith. Critics assailed the statute as a thinly veiled license for businesses and private parties to discriminate against the LGBT community. With socially conservative advocacy organizations including Advance America and the American Family Association of Indiana present at the bill signing, it was hard to combat the notion that the Indiana RFRA was a kind of consolation prize for those who had lost the fight to ban gay marriage in Indiana last year.The notion of religious freedom appears to have become the newest front in the culture wars as same-sex marriage becomes legal in more states around the country and with the U.S. Supreme Court set to rule on the issue by the end of June.\u201cThe meaning of these laws has changed now that they\u2019re very much embedded in these culture-war fights,\u201d said Douglas NeJaime, professor at the University of California Irvine, who specializes in sexual orientation law. \u201cSocial conservatives attempted to get a constitutional amendment through the legislature banning same-sex marriage and they were defending Indiana\u2019s marriage ban, and they lost both of those things. It\u2019s not accidental there\u2019s been a turn to religious liberty arguments.\u201dMore than 20 years ago, when the federal version of the RFRA \u2014 sponsored by then-Congressman Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \u2014 was signed into law, it was so uncontroversial it passed the House by a voice vote and the Senate 97-3. The bill was seen largely as a reaction to Employment Division v. Smith, a Supreme Court case in which the justices ruled in favor of the state of Oregon denying a Native American man his unemployment benefits because he was fired from his job for failing a drug test after smoking peyote as part of a religious ritual.But Eunice Hyun Min Rho, advocacy and policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said that in the late 1990s landlords began using the RFRA as a legal defense when they did not want to rent to unmarried heterosexual couples.\u201cThat sounded the alarm within the civil rights and civil liberties communities,\u201d Rho said. \u201cIt really raised concerns about how religion can be used to undermine local and state civil rights law.\u201dState versions of RFRAs have proliferated once again in the wake of another Supreme Court decision. In Hobby Lobby v. Burwell, the justices narrowly ruled last year that a corporation with religious owners could refuse to provide contraception coverage for its employees on the basis of a religious freedom argument under the federal RFRA.Following the Hobby Lobby decision, social conservatives saw an opportunity to take up the same religious argument to stave off the march of gay rights, analysts said. States began crafting their RFRA legislation with that goal apparently in mind, with Arizona being the first to confront major backlash for its discriminatory implications. Then-Gov. Jan Brewer eventually vetoed the legislation after it was passed in early 2014, but 13 other states are considering their own RFRA bills.Critics have said that Indiana\u2019s legislation, like Arizona\u2019s failed bill, is overly broad \u2014 both because it allows businesses to invoke religious beliefs and because the RFRA can be used in litigation between private parties, not just in lawsuits where the government is said to be burdening religious beliefs.In New Mexico, a photography studio tried to invoke a religious freedom defense when a same-sex couple sued it after it refused to provide services for a wedding. The state\u2019s Supreme Court ultimately ruled against the studio, and held that the RFRA did not apply because the government was not a party in the litigation. That would not be the case under Indiana\u2019s version of the law.\u201cThis is the state abdicating its central responsibility to make sure that its citizens are treated fairly,\u201d said Adam Talbot, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT advocacy group. \u201cThere are demonstrated cases where individuals have claimed a right to discriminate and gone to court over it. This is not speculation, it\u2019s not hypothetical. It\u2019s an existing problem that we\u2019ve seen time and time again.\u201dRobin Fretwell Wilson, director of the family law and policy program at the University of Illinois\u2019 College of Law, said \u201creligious freedom\u201d laws are a clumsy vehicle with which to discriminate. An individual or business trying to use the RFRA to deny services to LGBT individuals would have to prove in court that their religious beliefs were being \u201csubstantially burdened,\u201d and that there was not a compelling government interest in compelling them to do so \u2014 a difficult sell, Wilson said.\u201cRFRA\u2019s don\u2019t do that work \u2014 I don\u2019t think they do that, and I don\u2019t think they should do that,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to lose those kinds of cases, so I think it\u2019s a classic problem of both sides talking about something that is not the real issue. The real issue is that Indiana does not provide these protections for LGBT people.\u201dWilson noted that Indiana has no statewide anti-discrimination laws to protect individuals based on their sexual orientation. Adding such a measure would easily allay the controversy over the \u201creligious freedom\u201d statute, giving legal protections to both the faith community and the LGBT population, Wilson said.The real impact of the Indiana law remains to be seen. Legal experts said it was unclear what kind of court challenges the law would face given the legal precedents set by the Hobby Lobby decision and the federal RFRA. Gov. Pence and state Republicans have also vowed to clarify the law to explicitly state it does not give business the rights to refuse services.\"After much reflection and in consultation with the leadership of the general assembly, I've come to the conclusion that it would be helpful to move legislation this week that makes it clear that this law does not give businesses a right to deny services to anyone,\" Pence said Tuesday at a news conference. \u201cWe want to make it clear that Indiana is open for business.\u201d",

    "Nigeria President-elect Muhammadu Buhari has vowed to \u201cspare no effort\u201d to defeat Boko Haram \u2014 the brutal armed group that has plagued the oil-rich country with violence in recent years.In his first address to the nation since a landmark vote saw him elected to power, Buhari said that Nigeria had a \u201ctough and urgent\u201d job ahead, but that: \u201cBoko Haram will soon know the strength of our collective will and commitment to rid this nation of terror and bring back peace.\u201dThe comments came a day after the former military leader was announced the victor of a bitterly fought election campaign against outgoing president Goodluck Jonathan. The transition in presidency was described by the U.N. as a \u201ctestament to the maturity of Nigeria's democracy\u201d and was notable for the lack of widespread violence that beset the country after the last general election.On Wednesday, Buhari also congratulated Jonathan for peacefully relinquishing power, a day after the outgoing leader conceded in a move that has received praise both within Nigeria and internationally.\u201cPresident Jonathan was a worthy opponent and I extend the hand of fellowship to him,\u201d Buhari told journalists and supporters to loud applause Wednesday. \u201cWe have proven to the world that we are people who have embraced democracy. We have put one-party state behind us.\u201dThe margin of victory \u2014 Buhari got 15.4 million votes to Jonathan's 13.3 million \u2014 was enough to prevent any legal challenge.In an unprecedented step, Jonathan called Buhari to concede defeat and issued a statement urging his supporters to accept the result, a signal of deepening democracy in Africa's most populous nation that few had expected.He urged his supporters to follow \u201cdue process\u201d in channeling their frustrations at losing the election amid fear of violence.\u201cNobody's ambition is worth the blood of any Nigerian,\u201d Jonathan said in a statement issued after his election defeat. \u201cThe unity, stability and progress of our dear country is more important than anything else.\u201dThe rules state he must officially hand over power on May 29. His rival All Progressives Congress Party (APC) wasted no time in crowning him a \u201chero\u201d for his actions.Jonathan's People's Democratic Party (PDP) has been in power since the end of army rule in 1999, but had been losing support due to several oil sector corruption scandals and killings by rebel group Boko Haram in the northeast.\n\u201cYou voted for change and now change has come,\u201d Buhari said.Former military ruler Buhari became the first Nigerian to defeat a sitting president through the ballot box.\u201cThere had always been this fear that he might not want to concede, but he will remain a hero for this move. The tension will go down dramatically,\u201d said Lai Mohammed, a spokesman for the APC.Victory for Buhari is the first time in Nigeria's history that an opposition party has democratically taken control of the country from the ruling party.Al Jazeera's Haru Mutasa, reporting from Lagos, said there was shock that Jonathan had congratulated Buhari and that violence had not followed the announcement. In the 2011 election, more than 800 people were killed in protests after Buhari was defeated by Jonathan.\u201cThe announcement has been greeted with celebrations across the country,\u201d Mutasa said. \u201cMany people are excited and hope this will mark a new beginning and move the country forward.\u201dHundreds of Buhari's supporters gathered to celebrate outside his home in Abuja, with some brandishing brooms to symbolize his promise to clean up corruption.His supporters told Al Jazeera that the vote was \"free, fair and without irregularities\" as the country ushered in a new era.\u201cWe don't have roads, electricity and the youth are looking for jobs,\u201d one supporter said. \u201cThe people wanted change and change has now come.\u201dJonathan, whose five years in office have been plagued by corruption scandals and an insurgency by the Boko Haram group, was trailing by around 500,000 votes before votes in pro-opposition areas were counted.There was a brief protest by Jonathan's Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) before the counting had resumed on Tuesday.Former Niger Delta minister Godsday Orubebe accused elections chief Attahiru Jega of being \u201cpartial\u201d and \u201cselective.\u201dOrubebe claimed Jega had refused to investigate PDP complaints about big wins by Buhari in northern states, but had launched a probe into claims by the APC of irregularities in Rivers.Jega said later: \u201cI don't believe that the allegations are substantial enough to require the cancellation or rescheduling of the elections in Rivers state. We will take the results.\u201d\nInternational observers gave broadly positive reactions to the conduct of the vote, despite late delivery of election materials and technical glitches with new voter authentication devices.Nigeria's Transition Monitoring Group, which had observers across the country, said: \u201cThese issues did not systematically disadvantage any candidate or party.",
    "TERREBONNE PARISH, Louisiana \u2014 Streams of oil slid into the bayous of southeastern Louisiana after the Deepwater Horizon explosion in 2010, damaging the marsh grasses, the wildlife and the livelihood of the 17,000-member Houma tribe.The pollution also weakened the marshes, accelerating the rapid disappearance of coastal land that is taking the Houma Indians\u2019 culture with it.Now money that BP, the oil and gas company responsible for the spill, was forced to pay is beginning to flow to some groups and businesses to repair the environmental damage and protect the coast. But the Houma Indians say they haven't been compensated for the damage to the land they live on and fear they won't see funding for the protection and restoration projects they consider important.While the marshes have been eroding for years, due to levee building, oil pipelines and climate change, the Houma say the BP spill significantly worsened the problem.The United Houma Nation is officially recognized by the state of Louisiana but not by the federal government, making it hard for the Houma to negotiate compensation.\u201cThe United Houma Nation reached out to BP for assistance,\u201d said Principal Chief Thomas Dardar Jr. in a congressional hearing in 2012. But because the Houma aren\u2019t a federally acknowledged tribe, BP said it wasn\u2019t mandated to help, he said. A BP representative declined to comment.And yet the Houma and several other indigenous groups in the area  \u2014 including the Grand Bayou Village, Grand Caillou/Dulac, Isle de Jean Charles and Pointe-au-Chien tribes \u2014 are faced with a startling loss.Dardar\u2019s administrative assistant, Bette Billiot, drove her black minivan down a narrow road alongside Pointe-aux-Chenes Bayou in early December, the white feathers of a dreamcatcher swaying from her rearview mirror.The bayou is in Terrebonne Parish, one of six coastal parishes where the Houma and other Native peoples are concentrated.She pointed to the right. \u201cThat\u2019s Lora Ann Chaisson\u2019s property,\u201d she said. Chaisson, the vice principal chief of the Houma, used to own 15 acres, but only 12 acres of her land still exist. \u201cShe has three acres of water now,\u201d Billiot said.Billiot turned the van onto a narrow road leading to Isle de Jean Charles, a stretch of land that was inspiration for the 2012 film \u201cBeasts of the Southern Wild.\u201dFor years, it was home to a community of Native Americans. Once, 125 or so families lived there, she said. Now it\u2019s only about 25 families. The island was 5 miles wide and 11 miles long in the 1950s, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Now it\u2019s barely a quarter of a mile wide and 2 miles long.This area of southeastern Louisiana is simply melting away \u2014 an average of 16.57 square miles a year for the past 25 years, according to the Geological Survey.It\u2019s like losing the area of a football field every hour, said David Gauthe, a member of Bayou Interfaith Shared Community Organizing, a group of religious organizations concerned about environmental issues and poverty.And it\u2019s pushing Houma families out of the bayou.The Louisiana coast has been eroding for nearly 100 years, but only recently have alarm bells been sounding.Levees and dams on the Mississippi, built to control flooding beginning in the 1920s, had the unintended consequence of diverting silt that replenished the delta marshlands each year.The discovery of oil in the 1920s brought oil and gas companies into the area. Since then, the industry has laid 10,000 miles of pipeline in the Louisiana wetlands to carry the oil to refineries. In addition, companies cut canals through the marsh, creating what Dardar called a checkerboard.Storm surges from hurricanes then sent saltwater flowing through those channels, killing the freshwater plants in the marsh. Oil from the BP spill weakened the marshes and exacerbated the problem. On top of this, sea levels are rising because of climate change.Aerial pictures once showed swaths of land laced with narrow ribbons of bayou. Now the area looks more like a giant spiderweb, with thin strands of land and wide expanses of water.The oil and gas industry is responsible for 36 percent of the wetland loss, according to a study commissioned by the industry and published in 2000 (PDF). Sponsored by the Gas Research Institute in cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey, it shows the amount land loss caused by various activities, from channel dredging to oil extraction.And the industry doesn't want to pay; an unprecedented lawsuit against 97 oil and gas companies in Louisiana was filed in July 2013 by the board that oversees New Orleans flood protection.The Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority \u2013 East is suing companies such as ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Shell, BP, Chevron and Koch Industries, saying their marsh destruction is what allowed the Hurricane Katrina storm surge to flood New Orleans so catastrophically.But even if the lawsuit is successful, it\u2019s unclear how or if the lawsuit would benefit the Houma.The Houma Indians, who once lived in the area of Baton Rouge, moved down into the bayous back when the land was considered of little value. They went to avoid the 1830 Indian Removal Act and the Trail of Tears. In the marsh they established a self-sufficient way of life largely cut off from the rest of society until the 1950s.Early in December, three generations of the Verdin family went out crabbingAnesie Verdin, 67, gave directions to his grandson Beau, 19, who steered their 36-foot aluminum-hull boat down Point-aux-Chenes Bayou. Wild horses grazed in the tall grass along the shore. The trunks of trees killed by saltwater rose above the grass, a visible reminder of the dying marsh. A group of flamingos took flight, a soft pink in the early morning sun.Verdin\u2019s son Ernie pulled in the crab traps, shaking out a few blue crabs that were caught. Out in the open water, a dolphin followed the boat.As the boat re-entered the bayou, Verdin pointed beyond the marsh. \u201cThat used to be land. We used to trap for animals there. Now we fish for crabs in that same place.\u201dLouisiana is scrambling to address the severe coastline loss. A 50-year-plan that could cost $50 billion will bring in silt, build levees and nurture marsh regrowth.As the Verdin boat headed back to the dock, David Gauthe, who was also on board, pointed out the new levee that is part of the Morganza flood-control structure of the Gulf Hurricane Protection System.It doesn\u2019t extend to Isle de Jean Charles, he said, which is effectively excluded by the coastal protection plan.Later in the day, Verdin and his wife, Jane, went to the Dulac Community Center for a showing of a film made by their younger cousin Monique.Monique\u2019s film \u201cMy Louisiana Love\u201d chronicles her deep love for the land and sense of loss and disconnection from it. Verdin said she was drawn to the old ways of her grandmother and other ancestors.But \u201cI\u2019m inheriting a dying delta,\u201d she says in the film.Lanor Curole, project director of United Houma Nation, also expressed the loss. \u201cHow do you maintain a sense of your culture and community when the very land is disappearing underneath you?\u201d she asked.People may not care, she said, \u201cuntil it\u2019s their community.\u201d",
    "CHIBOK, Nigeria \u2014 In Chibok, the village in northeastern Nigeria\u2019s restive Borno state that is still suffering the loss of more than 200 schoolgirls, residents welcomed Monday's election results showing Muhammadu Buhari had defeated President Goodluck Jonathan.Many in Chibok view Jonathan as a failure and are hoping that Buhari will offer solutions to ensuring the return of the missing girls.\u201cI am very happy because I now have a new government that I can also try to engage with to make sure our girls come back,\u201d said Allen Manasseh. \u201cI tried to engage the government of Goodluck Jonathan but the government treated us as if we were criminals just because we were demanding our girls.\u201dSome voters traveled hundreds of miles to cast their votes in Saturday's landmark presidential election.\u201cI know it was a huge risk but it is my civic duty to cast my ballot,\u201d said Allen Manasseh, who traveled over 400 miles from the capital, Abuja, to Chibok, his hometown, where he cast his vote on Saturday. His cousin Maryam was one of the kidnapped girls, and Manasseh is still hoping for her return. \u201cWe will keep demanding for our girls to come back,\u201d he said.Like many in Chibok, Manasseh is disappointed in Jonathan\u2019s handling of the mass abduction of the schoolgirls on April 14 by Boko Haram. It took more than a week for Jonathan to make a public comment on the abduction, and he has still never visited the troubled community to express his condolences. \u201cI tried to engage the government of Goodluck Jonathan, but the government treated us as if we were criminals just because we were demanding our girls,\u201d Manasseh said.Chibok voters went to the polls on Saturday, and the main opposition party, led by the former military ruler Buhari, won by more than 7,000 votes. Nationwide, Buhari defeated Jonathan by a landslide, with a margin of more than 2 million votes. Jonathan issued a statement on Tuesday congratulating Buhari, and across Africa\u2019s most populous nation, Buhari supporters celebrated an unprecedented moment \u2014 the first time an opposition candidate has won a presidential election in Nigeria, and an expected peaceful transition of power.Buhari\u2019s campaign slogan of \u201cchange\u201d appealed to Nigerians seeking an administration that will tackle rampant corruption and an economy suffering from a falling currency. But for many in northeastern Nigeria, where Boko Haram has killed more than 13,000 people and displaced more than 1 million in its campaign to establish a state ruled by their extreme interpretation of Sharia, security is the number one issue.\u201cSecurity is the priority,\u201d said Bulus Mungopark, a leader in Chibok\u2019s vigilante force. \u201cAnd concerning our girls, we believe Buhari will do everything to find our girls because Jonathan is too weak to do so.\u201dBuhari\u2019s military background appeals to those frustrated with Jonathan\u2019s inability to defeat Boko Haram after more than six years. Nigerian soldiers have been accused of being too heavy-handed in their attempts to clear villages of suspected Boko Haram fighters, and also of running away from oncoming Boko Haram attacks. The armed group has turned into a threat to regional security, and Nigeria\u2019s neighbors have stepped into the fight.Mungopark traveled for two days from Maiduguri to Chibok to cast his vote. He said he has engaged with Boko Haram fighters on numerous occasions, sometimes alongside Nigerian troops. Since February, the Nigerian military has made some gains in the fight against the armed group.\u201cI am very much happy because there is a change,\u201d said Mungopark.",
    "The number of executions carried out worldwide in 2014 dropped significantly compared to a year earlier, but the number of death sentences that were issued spiked to nearly 2,500 \u2014 a 28 percent jump from 2013, according to a report released Tuesday by Amnesty International.The rights group said that at least 607 executions took place across the world in 2014, down from 778 in 2013. That figure excludes executions that took place in China, which Amnesty said treats death penalty data as a \u201cstate secret\u201d and has \u201ccarried out more executions than the rest of the world combined.\u201d Amnesty estimates that China executes more than 1,000 individuals a year.Three countries \u2014 Iran (289), Iraq (61) and Saudi Arabia (90) \u2014 accounted for 72 percent of all recorded executions in 2014. The U.S., with 35 executions, had the fifth-highest number of executions in 2014.While the number of executions fell, Amnesty says the increase in the number of death sentences handed down is due in significant part to mass sentences in Egypt and Nigeria, both of which have dealt with \"internal conflict and political instability.\" At least 2,466 death sentences were handed down worldwide in 2014, with Egypt and Nigeria accounting for 1,168 of them.In June 2014, a court in Egypt confirmed death sentences for more than 180 people, including the spiritual leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, which Egypt labeled a terrorist organization in December 2013. A court later overturned the death sentences for 36 people in the case.The death sentences stemmed from a police station attack in August 2013 near the southern city of Minya that left one police officer and one civilian dead. Charges against the defendants in the case included murder, joining a terrorist organization and terrorizing civilians.\u201cThe dark trend of governments using the death penalty in a futile attempt to tackle real or imaginary threats to state security and public safety was stark last year,\" Salil Shetty, the secretary general of Amnesty, said in a press release. \"It is shameful that so many states around the world are essentially playing with people\u2019s lives \u2014 putting people to death for \u2018terrorism\u2019 or to quell internal instability on the ill-conceived premise of deterrence.\"Amnesty did tout some of its findings as \"positive,\" including the National Assembly of Madagascar adopting a bill that abolishes the death penalty, though the rights group noted it has yet to be signed by the country's president. The report noted that similar bills to abolish the death penalty remain pending in the legislatures of Benin, Chad, Fiji, Mongolia and Suriname.The Amnesty report also said that 22 countries carried out executions last year, a significant drop from the 42 countries that recorded state executions 20 years ago.\"The death penalty is becoming a thing of the past,\" Shetty said. \u201cThe few countries that still execute need to take a serious look in the mirror and ask themselves if they want to continue to violate the right to life, or join the vast majority of countries that have abandoned this ultimate cruel and inhuman punishment.\"",
    "It may appear confusing at first glance that the U.S. is supporting a Saudi-led military intervention against Iran-backed Houthi forces in Yemen while waging its own air campaign in support of Iran\u2019s allies fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in Tikrit, Iraq \u2014 and negotiating a nuclear accord with Tehran. But there\u2019s a coherent strategic thread linking these three seemingly disparate processes.Yemen is Saudi Arabia\u2019s neighbor and has traditionally loomed large in its national security thinking. The recent evisceration of Saudi allies in Sanaa suggest Riyadh took its eye off the ball, but Saudi success in establishing a broad coalition to fight the Houthi takeover in Yemen represents a feather in the cap of the new ruler, King Salman. By persuading states such as Turkey, Egypt, Qatar and the UAE to join forces in what they see as a bid to aggressively roll back Iranian influence, Salman has transcended the divisions among Sunni Muslim powers over the Muslim Brotherhood. The Yemen intervention reflects Riyadh\u2019s success in prioritizing the confrontation against Iran, and it is through this lens that the battle in Yemen is now being seen.For the Saudi-led alliance to win in Yemen entails reinstalling Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi as president, rolling back Houthi military gains and forming a governing alliance in which the Houthi were at most a distinctly junior partner. Achieving such an outcome could make the Saudi leadership less skittish in its overall regional contest with Iran, which it has been perceived as losing.Strong backing for the Saudi-led effort in Yemen allows Barack Obama\u2019s administration to dispel the notion \u2014 widely (albeit mistakenly) held in Arab capitals and by some critics in Congress and the U.S. foreign policy establishment \u2014 that nuclear diplomacy presages a broader U.S. realignment in favor of Iran and at the expense of traditional U.S. allies in the Gulf.Yemen, moreover, has the advantage of being an arena in which the U.S. and Sunni allies can push back at Iran without threatening Tehran\u2019s vital interests. Iran has a limited stake and less investment in Yemen than it does in Syria, Lebanon or Iraq. There are no selfies of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps commander Qassem Suleimani living large in Sanaa. The Houthi-Tehran alliance is not as tight as is depicted, and Tehran may well have deemed the Houthi advance in Yemen as an overreach \u2014 although once successful, it likely became an opportunity to be leveraged. Iran has certainly left itself plenty of room to retreat in Yemen, which would deflate hyperbolic claims of an Iranian regional surge that are being used to mobilize opposition to a nuclear deal that remains Tehran\u2019s (and Washington\u2019s) greater immediate priority.The simultaneous U.S. airstrikes in Tikrit suggests a U.S. ability to take a more nuanced approach to its still extensive regional entanglements. By diversifying the range of partners with which it can work, even ad hoc, and encouraging regional initiatives to tackle local problems, the Obama administration is taking another decisive step away from the failed interventionist policies and Manichaean worldview of the George W. Bush years. Sanaa, Tikrit and the nuclear negotiations in Switzerland are all indicative of that trend. Still, they come at a moment rife with risk and possibilities of miscalculation.There is no guarantee that the Saudi-led military alliance will win a quick and clean victory in Yemen or that its intervention will demonstrate the strength and competence that it hopes will deter Iran. A Saudi failure, stalemate or escalation could boost Arab anxieties over Iran or spark wider clashes across the region that would undermine the Western effort to prioritize fighting ISIL.Iran, for its part, may not sacrifice its Houthi chip quite so easily; it may be tempted, instead, to suck the Saudis deeper into a costly Yemeni quagmire.And any sustained U.S. military action in the region, whether to support of old allies or to push back new foes (such as ISIL) carries the risk of blowback or mission creep and of undercutting U.S. goals in Yemen, Iraq and Syria.With the nuclear talks having reached a challenging phase for Iran regarding the pace of sanctions removal and questions about Obama\u2019s ability to deliver, given Washington\u2019s political divisions, Iranian opponents of nuclear compromise may seek to use developments in Yemen to tilt Tehran\u2019s internal debate in their favor.And then there is Yemen itself.Unless the Saudi-led intervention transitions rapidly from military strikes to inclusive diplomacy and governance, Yemen will face further destruction, decay and radicalization, adding to an already formidable array of challenges \u2014 from the presence of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIL to impoverishment and environmental degradation. Even if the regional contest playing out in Yemen can ultimately be managed by the external stakeholders, it is likely to come at the expense of the long-suffering Yemeni people.Daniel Levy is the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the European Council on Foreign Relations, where Julien Barnes-Dacey is a senior policy fellow.",

    "Saudi Arabia\u2019s new policy of uniting Sunni Muslim powers against Iran\u2019s Shia regime has resulted in an impressively broad coalition joining its military campaign against Yemen\u2019s pro-Tehran Houthi rebels.Along with five Gulf countries, and the poorer monarchies of Jordan and Morocco, it also enlisted the support of its Egyptian strongman ally, general-turned-president Abdel Fattah El Sisi. Even plucky Sudan has dispatched three fighter jets.Differences over issues such as the Muslim Brotherhood were suppressed in the interests of building a broad anti-Iran coalition that extended beyond the Arab world. Turkey announced on Thursday that it supports the Saudi-led offensive, with President Recep Tayyep Erdogan issuing a spirited harangue that branded Iran\u2019s actions a source of \u201cannoyance.\u201dBut perhaps the biggest surprise has been the reported inclusion of Pakistan. Al-Arabiya, the Saudi-owned broadcaster, said Islamabad was providing military support. The habitually evasive Pakistani Foreign Office said simply that they were mulling a Saudi request for troops, while Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif vowed Thursday to retaliate against any threat to Saudi Arabia\u2019s \"integrity.\"A senior member of Sharif\u2019s cabinet told Al Jazeera that Pakistan will not be involved in any action \u201cin Yemen\u201d itself but will provide support to the Saudis on their own soil \u201cif they are threatened.\u201d On Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported Pakistani and Saudi forces were carrying out a joint exercise near the Yemeni border, and quoted a U.S. official as saying the move was designed to serve as a warning to the Houthi rebels.Unlike the Turks, who are incensed by Tehran\u2019s involvement in propping up the regime of Syria\u2019s President Bashar al-Assad, Pakistan has no active dispute with Iran. The Saudis and Turks have made common cause in Syria and now Yemen despite backing rival factions in Tunisia, Libya and Egypt.Pakistan, by contrast, has remained distant from the Syrian conflict, facing a compelling threat at home. Since the December massacre of Peshawar schoolchildren, it has renewed its resolve to eliminate the Pakistani Taliban \u2014 a notoriously sectarian organization that has terrorized Pakistan\u2019s Shia population, the largest outside Iran. Around one in five Pakistanis is Shia, as was the country\u2019s founder, Mohammed Ali Jinnah.Still, it now finds itself drawn into a geopolitical alliance with a strongly sectarian pallor.This isn\u2019t first time Pakistan has been dragged into the poisonous Saudi-Iranian rivalry. After the 1979 revolution that brought the Ayatollahs to power, Pakistan became a battlefield in a proxy war between the two countries. The Iranians established armed Shia groups in Pakistan; the Saudis countered by sponsoring anti-Shia groups \u2014 a tradition that continues to this day, with millions of dollars funneled from the desert kingdom into thousands of Pakistani madrassas teaching extreme ideas.For the Saudis, the appeal of Pakistan is obvious. It shares a border with Iran and, crucially, already has nuclear weapons. The Saudis want Pakistan to act as a counterweight to Iran, and have long cultivated a close relationship with its military. Since the late 1960s, Pakistani soldiers have been permanently garrisoned in Saudi Arabia. In 1969, Pakistani pilots slipped into Saudi jets to carry out sorties in South Yemen against a rebel threat at the time.For Pakistan, Saudi Arabia is not only a long-standing source of aid but a principal source of foreign exchange through much-needed remittances. Just last month, for example, $453 million flowed into Pakistan from the exertions of more than 1.5 million often poorly treated migrant workers. The intimacy of the two countries\u2019 ruling elites notwithstanding, the migrant workers are weighed down by debts they owe to exploitative recruiters. Pakistanis are also disproportionately found in Saudi Arabia\u2019s jails and on death row.The relationship, however, is one-sided. \u201cWe in Saudi Arabia are not observers in Pakistan, we are participants,\u201d Saudi Arabia\u2019s current ambassador in Washington, Adel al-Jubeir, boasted in 2007, according to a leaked State Department cable. Its clout extends to the realm of politics, where the Saudis have keenly backed military rulers and right-wing politicians \u2014 Prime Minister Sharif lived in exile in Jeddah after the Kingdom persuaded then dictator Pervez Musharraf to release him from prison.As Prince Waleed ibn Talal once told to the Wall Street Journal, \u201cNawaz Sharif, specifically, is very much Saudi Arabia\u2019s man in Pakistan.\u201d The Saudis last year injected $1.5 billion into Pakistan\u2019s treasury, boosting its liquidity at moment when it is still strapped to an exacting IMF loan package.Sharif\u2019s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz party is seen within Pakistan to favor Sunnis, and as having ties with sectarian groups. It has few Shia parliamentarians and few Shia voters.Pakistan\u2019s army, however, has never had a sectarian reputation. It has included many Shia generals, although their numbers have thinned over the years. Some of the worst victims of the Pakistani Taliban\u2019s savagery were Shia soldiers, who were murdered in captivity. Becoming an overtly Sunni army would compromise the Pakistan military\u2019s proud claim of being a force of cohesion for the country, and risk alienating many Shia Pakistanis, at a time when there is a clamor for unity against the Taliban at home.This may also be a bad time for Pakistan to pick a fight with Iran. In recent years, relations between the neighbors have veered between periods of economic cooperation and cross-border tensions, particularly over Sunni armed groups targeting the Iranian regime from Pakistani territory in Balochistan.But as it battles the Pakistani Taliban along the Afghan border, Islamabad is trying to facilitate a postwar settlement across the border by bringing to bear its considerable influence over the Afghan Taliban. Ashraf Ghani, the Afghan president, has developed closer relations with the Pakistani leadership than his predecessor, Hamid Karzai, had ever managed to achieve. But any eventual settlement in Afghanistan will inevitably involve Iran, whose influence in the country was such that even the U.S. sought Tehran\u2019s cooperation during and after its 2001 invasion to topple the Taliban.Being drawn into the Middle East\u2019s sectarian battles, then, carries greater domestic and regional risk for Pakistan than it does for most of the Saudis\u2019 other partners.",
    "When Eli Erlick was 8 years old, she would sometimes pretend to be sick, just so she could leave school and go home to use the bathroom. She had asked to use the girls\u2019 bathroom at her school in Mendocino County, California, but she wasn\u2019t allowed to.\u201cI had no idea why I couldn\u2019t do this,\u201d Erlick said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know the word \u2018transgender.\u2019 I just knew that I was a girl,\u201d she said, and so it didn\u2019t feel right to use the boys\u2019 bathroom. This continued until she was 13, when she began her gender transition.Erlick, now 19, is a second-year student at Pitzer College near Los Angeles and director of Trans Student Education Resources (TSER), a student-led advocacy group. When she was a senior in high school, she worked to help craft California\u2019s School Success and Opportunity Act, a 2013 law \u2014 the first of its kind in the nation \u2014 that requires the state\u2019s public schools to allow trans students to use the bathrooms and play on the sports teams that correspond with their gender identities.After that landmark legislation in California, some states are pushing in the other direction, and bathrooms and locker rooms are starting to become key battlegrounds in the nationwide fight for the rights of transgender children.\u201cMy story isn\u2019t uncommon at all,\u201d Erlick said. \u201cThere are thousands of trans youth who are being denied these resources every day.\u201dThis month, lawmakers in three states have proposed legislation that would limit transgender children from using facilities that correspond to their gender identities. Nevada Assemblywoman Victoria Dooling, a Republican, proposed a bill on March 19 that would require kids at public schools to use the restrooms and showers that correspond to their biological sex at birth. Republican lawmakers in Minnesota put forth two bills in March that would require schoolchildren to use bathrooms and participate on the sports teams that match their gender at birth, and the Kentucky State Senate approved a similar bill.The Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law, a think tank that researches sexual orientation and gender identity, released a study in 2013 about the effects of denying access to certain bathrooms on transgender individuals. The study found that nearly 60 percent of the transgender people it surveyed said they had avoided going out in public because of worries about safe access to public restrooms, and 54 percent said they had physical problems like dehydration or kidney infections from trying to avoid using public bathrooms.These proposed laws do offer some compromises: The Minnesota bill says schools would be required to provide \u201cplaces of public accommodation on the grounds of gender identity or expression.\u201d But advocates say that these laws are a clear signal that transgender children are not welcome in common spaces. Opponents of the Kentucky legislation call it the \u201cbathroom bully\u201d bill because they say it would open the door for children to judge each other based on perceived gender identity.Other recent laws go even further. Lawmakers in Florida proposed a bill in February that applies to any sex-segregated public facility, not just in public schools, and calls for a $1,000 fine for violators and a potential prison term of up to a year. A bill introduced in the Texas legislature in February would bar someone from entering a locker room or bathroom meant for women if that person has a Y chromosome. Violating the law would be a felony, and attendants who repeatedly allow trans people to enter could be charged with a felony and do jail time, according to the bill\u2019s text.Texas State Rep. Debbie Riddle, a Republican, wrote in a Facebook post in January that the new bill \u201cwill protect women & children from going into a ladies restroom & finding a man who feels like he is a woman that day.\u201dAdvocates for transgender rights say the increased visibility of transgender people in American culture in recent years is triggering this legislative backlash, particularly in states, such as Nevada, that have already passed laws that protect transgender students or employees from gender discrimination.\u201cIt\u2019s a second bite of the apple for lawmakers who are not happy that their states or entities within their states had moved to protect students,\u201d said Michael Silverman, executive director of the New York City-based Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund.If these proposed bathroom bills do get signed into law, they are likely to face legal challenges. Gender identity and expression is included in Title IX of the Education Amendments Act, a 1972 law that protects all public school students from gender discrimination. \u201cThe Departments of Justice and Education have made it clear that they intend to protect transgender students from unequal treatment in school,\u201d Silverman said.At least two recent lawsuits have already successfully upheld access to bathrooms for transgender children. In 2013, the family of Coy Mathis, a transgender first-grader, won a lawsuit against their Colorado school district that allowed her to use the girls\u2019 bathroom. In 2014, Maine's highest court ruled in favor of transgender student Nicole Maines after she sued when her high school required her to use a separate restroom for staff.\u201cTransgender people are probably 20 years behind lesbian and gay people in terms of public understanding of who they are and public acceptance,\u201d Silverman said. \u201cThat makes the transgender community an easy scapegoat now for people who no longer target the gay and lesbian community because it won\u2019t be tolerated. We need to create the conditions where legislators know that they cannot target transgender people either.\u201d",
    "This story was told by Ladi Apagu to Chika Oduah in January, and translated from Hausa, at St. Theresa\u2019s Catholic Church in Yola. It has been edited for length. This is the second in a two-part series on women who escaped Boko Haram captivity. In the first part, three women, including Apagu, describe their imprisonment at and escapes from a house in Gulak.YOLA, Nigeria \u2014 Boko Haram entered Sabon Gari village about 7 p.m. We heard gunshots. The shots sounded like thunder, so the children were jumping and smiling and singing, \u201cLet the rain come, let the rain come.\u201d But I realized it was not thunder.Boko Haram fighters were everywhere. We saw them on the motorbikes shooting and burning houses. All night, the sound of guns shooting was in the air. They left in the morning. I was so scared, but I didn\u2019t have anywhere else to go, so I stayed.After the fourth attack, I decided to leave Sabon Gari because I know Boko Haram likes to kidnap girls. I went to Gulak to live with my great-aunt. Later I learned that Boko Haram attacked Sabon Gari a fifth time.Then in September, Boko Haram came to Gulak. As soon as I heard the gunshots, I told my great aunt that I am leaving Gulak. The old woman became sad, and she asked me to stay with her because she is old and did not want to be left by herself. I told her that I cannot stay because Boko Haram kidnaps girls my age. She understood, so I fled. I ran, joined by a Muslim woman who was a distant relative. As we were running, we saw a soldier behind us. At first, we were alarmed. We thought it was a Boko Haram member wearing a soldier uniform. But the soldier told us not to worry, that he is also running away from Boko Haram.The woman and I fled into the bush and spent about a week sleeping and eating there. It was uncomfortable, and I suffered.I hated staying in the bush, especially when it rained. I decided it was better to leave the bush, even if Boko Haram killed me. So the woman and I ran to a mountain. At night, it was cold. And after a few days living there, Boko Haram came very close to where we were staying. We escaped and went to a house we saw in another village.We stayed with a Muslim family there for some days, but then we heard Boko Haram fighters. They were coming fast, so we all ran away. The family told us they were going to Gulak. They told me to join them there, but I told them that Boko Haram fighters are inside Gulak. They told me that they would protect me because they are Muslims with good knowledge of the Quran, so Boko Haram will not harm them. I decided to follow them, but Boko Haram was still shooting in the street, and I somehow lost the Muslim family. I kept running, looking for them, but I could not find them. So I joined some women on the street who were also running toward Gulak.In Gulak I found the Muslim family who had taken care of me. They told me I need to leave because Boko Haram is going around, killing people who are not Muslims.So I left. I didn\u2019t know where to go, but I knew I just had to run. In my confusion, I bumped into some young Christian girls. We went to hide in the mountains and heard many gunshots. We could not detect where the gunshots were coming from because the mountains made the sound of gunshots echo. I was so confused. We ran down the mountain, and we got lost. And that\u2019s how we ended back up in Gulak. Right away, a Boko Haram member saw me and told me to stop running. He threatened to shoot my legs, but the other Boko Haram member with him said it is not good to shoot women.I asked them where are they taking me to. They told me they are taking me to a place where I will worship Allah. In Gulak they drove to a big house that was surrounded by a barbed wire fence. When I entered the house, I saw many other girls who were close to my age. They, too, had been abducted. I saw some of the Christian girls I met in the mountains.Boko Haram members asked if we will convert to Islam, and we said no. There were some girls who did agree to convert, so the insurgents separated those who agreed to convert and those who did not. They held a big knife up to my neck and asked me, \u201cYou do not want to convert to Islam? We will kill you along with this retired soldier we captured over there who also refuses to convert.\u201d So I finally said, \u201cYes, I will convert.\u201d I begged them not to kill me.They brought out one man who they said they had captured from a neighboring village. They put him on the ground. The man begged for his life. Then the insurgents set their flag behind the man and slaughtered him right in front of us girls.There were many Boko Haram fighters in that house. They had long hair, which they brush down and pack it into three long braids. They were very dirty. Some of them wore turbans on their heads. They were speaking many languages \u2014 Kanuri, Arabic, Hausa and Fulani.I stayed in that house from October until January. Every day, we had to pray five times and read our Quranic studies, but I would often forget to do so. Whenever they found me not praying or studying the Quran, they would beat me and the other girls, 10 lashes each. If we did not wake up early enough in the morning to pray, they poured cold water on us. One day, they dragged out one girl who refused to pray, pulling her in front of us so we could see them shout at her. They said they will take her to Madagali town, to a place that they call their prison. The girl disappeared, and for six days we never saw her. When they returned, she had changed. She did her prayers and Quranic studies without complaint.I was suffering so much. We saw the women that the Boko Haram members use as cooks in another part of the house. Sometimes the women would pity us and sneak us extra food.Every day, more girls arrived in the house from other towns that Boko Haram had attacked. They kept kidnapping women and girls. The number of girls I shared a bedroom with kept growing, from 10 to 20 to 30. It\u2019s a very big house.",
    "The United States is lifting its hold on the supply of military equipment to Egypt, which was frozen when the military took power in Cairo nearly two years ago.The White House said Tuesday that President Barack Obama was freeing up the equipment and making other changes to military ties with Washington's long-time ally to support U.S. interests while encouraging Egypt's political reforms.Obama directed the release of 12 Lockheed Martin F-16 aircraft, 20 Boeing Harpoon missiles, and up to 125 M1A1 Abrams tank kits made by General Dynamics, said National Security Council spokesperson Bernadette Meehan.This was \u201cin the interest of U.S. national security,\u201d she said.The decision was announced after a telephone call between Obama and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi in which they also discussed the turmoil that is gripping the region.Sisi is leading an initiative to form a unified Arab military force in the region to confront Iranian-allied fighters in Yemen, and other threats.The White House said Washington would \u201cmodernize\u201d the way it provided military aid to Cairo to focus on counterterrorism, border security, maritime security and Sinai security, where the armed group Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has been active.\u201cIn this way, we will ensure that U.S. funding is being used to promote shared objectives in the region, including a secure and stable Egypt and the defeat of terrorist organizations,\u201d Meehan said in a statement.Obama told Sisi he would continue to ask the U.S. Congress for $1.3 billion in military aid for Egypt per year, but said the United States would stop allowing Egypt to buy equipment on credit starting in fiscal year 2018, the White House said.Rights activists expressed concern. Resuming full military aid would send a dangerous message that human rights were not a priority concern for the United States, said Neil Hicks, a director at Human Rights First.Egypt has been the second-largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid since its peace treaty with Israel in 1979.Aid was frozen after the Egyptian army overthrew former President Mohamed Morsi. Obama resisted calling that a coup because it would have resulted in aid being cut completely.Some restrictions were relaxed last year, but Congress made aid dependent on the U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry certifying that Egypt was taking certain steps to govern democratically, a delay which angered the Egyptian government.Kerry is expected to tell Congress within the next two weeks that the aid is in the U.S. national security interest, even though he will not make the \u201cdemocracy certification,\u201d a senior administration official said.Reuters",
    "Opponents of a nuclear deal with Iran are already calling the deal over which negotiators continue to bargain in Lausanne the \u201cApril Fool\u2019s Accord.\u201d But the fact that diplomats from Iran and the five permanent members of the P5+1 group of world powers continued talking past their midnight March 31 deadline is a sign of their seriousness, rather than the reverse.Russian and Iranian media reported early Wednesday Swiss time that an agreement had been reached and a statement would be released later in the day. A Western diplomat quickly contradicted those reports.From the perspective of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, the object of the marathon talks in the Swiss lakeside city is a statement of principles, accompanied by a document with enough specifics on Iranian concessions to fend off harsh critics in the U.S. Congress.At a minimum, Obama needs enough to once again convince Democrats to refrain from backing new sanctions legislation that could interfere with the executive branch\u2019s flexibility in the negotiations, whose real deadline for a comprehensive deal is June 30. Obama has vowed to veto any such legislation, and Senate Republicans would need 13 Democrats to join them to override a presidential veto.The administration is talking to members of Congress about ways in which they might modify proposed legislation in a manner that contributes to \u2014 rather than jeopardizes \u2014 an accord. The White House is also mobilizing potential \u201cvalidators,\u201d including former top foreign policy officials from both parties, to defend the outcome of the talks.They face an uphill battle.Martin Indyk, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel and special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, told Al-Jazeera, \u201cThe mood [in Washington] has turned against a deal because proponents don\u2019t know what they are defending, while opponents have been out there criticizing.\u201dDuring the past six days at a luxury hotel on Lake Geneva, negotiators have been trying to give proponents of a deal more ammunition. U.S. and European officials said Tuesday that considerable progress had been made, and that sticking points had narrowed to a crucial few.\u201cWe\u2019ve made enough progress in the last days to merit staying until Wednesday,\u201d State Department acting spokesperson Marie Harf emailed reporters. \u201cThere are several difficult issues still remaining.\u201dSources at the talks say Iran has agreed to a deal that would last 15 years \u2014 three times what Tehran had initially said it would accept \u2014 with verification measures and safeguard obligations that would continue indefinitely.The terms of the deal would close off all four potential pathways to creating fissile material for nuclear weapons \u2014 by capping the amount and purity of uranium enrichment at Natanz, banning it at the underground facility at Fordow, reconfiguring a heavy water reactor at Arak to minimize the potential for plutonium production and ramping up transparency to minimize potential for any covert weapons program.The agreement is designed to ensure the international community would have at least a year\u2019s warning of any breakout from Iran\u2019s nonproliferation obligations \u2014 instead of the three months they have now. In return, the Iranians expect rapid relief from economic sanctions and, in particular, lifting of U.N. Security Council resolutions that provide the basis for those sanctions.According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who returned to the talks on Tuesday after a 24-hour break, Iran is seeking a full cancellation of U.N. sanctions upfront, while the P5+1 is arguing for suspension and subsequent abolition of sanctions after Iran meets other requirements of the deal.\u201cBut what in practice this must mean,\u201d Lavrov told journalists, is \u201cthat the sanctions should no longer work and no longer hinder the development of legal trade and economic activity between Iran and its foreign partners.\u201dThe P5+1 and Iran have accepted that there will be a new U.N. resolution that takes note of whatever agreement they reach and outlines procedures for sanctions relief. However, France and the U.S. have sought to phase in sanctions relief and include a \u201csnapback\u201d provision that would automatically restore economic penalties if Iran is caught cheating or fails to fully implement its obligations. Russia and China appear to have sided with Iran against such a provision, meaning that they would retain the power to veto re-imposition of U.N. sanctions.Another sticking point is the amount of research and development on new centrifuges that Iran would be permitted to conduct in the latter years of the agreement. The deal is expected to restrict Iran to about 6,000 antiquated first-generation machines, known as P-1s or IR-1s, for at least a decade, and to reduce stockpiles of low-enriched uranium below an amount that could be further enriched to build a single nuclear weapon.Iran\u2019s delegation had not been enthusiastic about the March 31 deadline for a political framework, preferring to reveal the full parameters of an agreement in a single moment.Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has compared the nuclear negotiations to the talks that ended the Iran-Iraq war in 1988, has made clear his preference for one agreement, not two. Khamenei\u2019s predecessor, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini compared accepting a cease-fire with Iraq to drinking poison, and Khamenei evidently would rather drain the chalice in one go rather than in doses.However, the Iranian diplomats understand that Obama needs something concrete to fend off congressional critics as well as pressure from Israel and Gulf Arab powers. That may make fortuitous the timing of an interim agreement this week, falling during Congress\u2019s Easter break, Iran's prolonged New Year celebrations and Israeli negotiations over forming a new coalition government.Longtime observers of U.S.-Iran relations believe that both governments have invested so much political capital in these negotiations over the past 18 months that they cannot afford to allow them to fail. For Obama, an Iran nuclear agreement would be a crowning foreign policy achievement, while for Iranians, a deal would bring a welcome injection of oxygen to an economy choked by sanctions, low oil prices and government mismanagement.\u201cBoth sides cannot afford defeat at this point,\u201d Vali Nasr, a specialist on the region who is now dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, told Al Jazeera.  \u201cThey will come out with a formula that says, \u2018We made progress.\u2019\u201d",

But that's no guarantee that complaints will be formally investigated or lead to charges.The Palestinian Liberation Organization, acting as the government of Palestine, on January 1 lodged a declaration under the court\u2019s Rome Statute, accepting the jurisdiction of the ICC over alleged crimes committed since June 13, 2014 \u2014 the day after the kidnapping of three Israeli teenagers sparked a massive Israeli raid on Palestinian communities in the West Bank, and eventually war on Gaza. Amnesty International has accused Israel of war crimes for its Gaza campaign in which more than 2,000 Palestinians were killed, while thousands more were wounded and at least 100,000 civilians were left homeless.On the other hand, rockets launched from Gaza indiscriminately targeting Israeli population centers could also be examined by the court for crimes \u2014 a Human Rights Watch report branded them as such.ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda on Jan. 16, as a matter of policy, responded to the Palestinian declaration with a preliminary examination to determine whether the criteria have been met to merit pursuing a formal investigation: were war crimes or crimes against humanity committed and were those crimes grave enough to merit the court\u2019s attention. In addition, if there were any investigations being conducted in good faith by the state \u2013 Israel or Palestine \u2013 in relation to potential cases being considered for investigation by the court, in which case the ICC would refrain from involvement.\u201cThose investigations have to be credible and genuine,\" Balkees Jarrah, International Justice Counsel at Human Rights Watch and expert on the ICC, told Al Jazeera. \"The ICC is a court that was established to be a court of last resort and will only step in when that isn\u2019t taking place.\"If the office of the prosecutor decides to move forward with opening a formal investigation, judicial approval is required to proceed. But as of April 1, Palestine as a member of the ICC can refer a situation to the prosecutor, and judicial approval is not required for the prosecutor to initiate a formal investigation. Only member states and the UN Security Council, but not citizens, can refer a situation to the ICC.If such an investigation finds evidence that Israeli or Palestinian individuals are responsible for serious crimes, the court would request that the state in which they reside execute an arrest warrant \u2013 which would require judicial approval \u2013 and surrendering of suspects to the court. It's not hard to see why state cooperation in arresting suspects would prove challenging in the case of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The ICC has, for instance, been unable to bring Sudan President Omar Al-Bashir to trial despite after two arrest warrants, issued in 2009 and 2010.Israel\u2019s settlement activity may also be subject to ICC scrutiny for violating Article 8 of the Rome Statute, which states that the below constitutes as war crimes:\u201cThe transfer, directly or indirectly, by the Occupying Power of parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies, or the deportation or transfer of all or parts of the population of the occupied territory within or outside this territory.\u201dAll Israeli settlements in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and other territories occupied since 1967 are illegal under international law. However, settlements continue to be built with impunity today totaling more than 600,000 settlers on lands that Palestinians would see as part of their state.Any future settlement developments will be subject to the court's rule.But it is now up to the states of Palestine and Israel to use this opportunity to present cases to the ICC for investigations of war crimes, however such actions will likely not be taken anytime soon. It is more likely that both sides will use it instead to threaten the other for leverage.Since Palestine was officially recognized as a state by the UN General Assembly in 2012, and therefore eligible to become a member of the ICC, the Palestinians have attempted to use their application to the court as a bargaining chip. The Palestinians only submitted their application to the ICC on Dec. 31 after failing to convince the UN Security Council to vote in favor of a two-year deadline to Israel's occupation.Israel then responded by freezing the release of tax revenues it collects on behalf of the Palestinians. Just days before Palestine's accession to the ICC was formalized, Israel announced it will release part of the taxes, a move seen as an attempt to slow the Palestinians from referring cases against Israel.",
    "The state of Palestine joined the International Criminal Court (ICC) on Wednesday, a move deeply opposed by Israel, vowing to hand over suspects to The Hague, including its own government officials.The Palestinians, who became the 123rd member of the world's permanent war crimes tribunal, said they would give prosecutors ample time to complete an initial inquiry into last year's Gaza conflict, but would formally request an investigation if it took too long.\"If it takes more [time] than expected ... we will ... issue a referral,\" Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki told Reuters in an interview, adding that his government would not hesitate to hand over Palestinian suspects if the court asked for them.The court is already examining possible crimes committed during last year's conflict in Gaza, and Maliki said he was confident that it would lead to a case, also conceding that it was \"probable\" Palestinians would also be charged.ICC membership \"could ensure justice for victims of very serious crimes, and sends an important message that grave abuse can\u2019t be committed with impunity,\u201d Balkees Jarrah, International Justice Counsel at Human Rights Watch and expert on the ICC, told Al Jazeera. \u201cPalestine\u2019s accession to the court is a positive step for justice and the rule of law, and giving the court a mandate could help deter war crimes.\u201dIt is ultimately up to the prosecutors whether they charge suspects, but a member state can request them to do so, a move against Israel the Palestinians will be reluctant to make.\u201cWere the actions grave enough during the attack on Gaza, I\u2019d certainly say so,\u201d Diana Buttu, Ramallah-based human rights lawyer and former legal advisor to the Palestine Liberation Organization, told Al Jazeera. However, she does not expect a \u201cheavy push\u201d from the Palestinians for alleged crimes committed before April 1. \u201cGoing forward, however, if Israel announces a new settlement plan, for example, Palestine can lodge a compliant about that,\u201d Buttu said.Accession to the court is part of the Palestinians' campaign to win global recognition of statehood, but Israel says such unilateral moves damage prospects for a negotiated solution to the decades-old conflict.With the court swamped with investigations in Africa and prosecutors already struggling to secure convictions, any case over alleged crimes in the occupied territories is unlikely to come to trial for some years \u2014 if ever.Palestinian membership gives the court's prosecutors the right to examine war crimes committed by any party on its territory after April 1, a development contested by Israel, which is not an ICC member and has no plans to cooperate.\"I don\u2019t understand the opposition unless [Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin] Netanyahu fears the court and what it might do,\" Maliki said.\"If he believes his army is the most moral army in the world ... then he should not fear our accession to the court.\"Al Jazeera and wire services.

    "New Jersey native Sharif Mobley, who was abducted by Yemeni security forces in 2010, made a distressed phone call to his lawyers Monday, saying that warplanes were bombing the military base where he was being detained.The call, in which he pleaded for the U.S. government to help him escape, was the first time Mobley has spoken to his legal team in over a year, according to Reprieve, the legal charity representing him.Five years ago in Yemen\u2019s capital, Sanaa, eight masked Yemeni security officials burst out of two white vans, shot Mobley in the legs and shoved him into a van, according to legal documents seen by Al Jazeera.Mobley\u2019s lawyers at Reprieve say the FBI interrogated Mobley shortly after this violent kidnapping. The Yemeni officers said at the time they were acting at the behest of an FBI attach\u00e9 that suspected Mobley of having ties to Al-Qaeda\u2019s Yemen branch, according to Mobley\u2019s lawyers.This alleged practice of proxy detention where the FBI facilitates or exploits the arrests of U.S. citizens by foreign governments has been widely condemned by civil libertarians, who say it circumvents due process rights by leaving the interrogation of suspects to others.\u201cPresident Obama promised never to repeat Bush-era abuses, but the worry is that now the U.S. may be simply outsourcing torture and disappearances in order to keep its fingerprints off the crime scene,\u201d Cori Crider, a member of Mobley\u2019s legal team, told Al Jazeera.In September of last year, Houthi rebels captured Sanaa and the base where Mobley is being held from the internationally recognized Yemeni government.During Monday's phone call, in which explosions could be heard in the background, Mobley pleaded for U.S. authorities to evacuate him from the prison. Mobley said Houthi fighters were firing anti-aircraft weapons at Saudi-led warplanes, which were targeting the base.Saudi Arabia is currently leading a regional coalition in a campaign against Houthi rebels, who have overrun much of the country. While not taking direct military action, the U.S. has said it is coordinating military and intelligence support with Saudi Arabia.To push back against the Houthis, Saudi-led warplanes have targeted military bases and anti-aircraft positions located in populated neighborhoods in Sanaa, flattening homes and killing civilians.In Monday's phone call, Mobley said he was being held in the basement cell of a base in Haddah, a southwestern suburb of Sanaa.\"I\u2019m afraid for my life,\u201d he told his lawyers. \"There\u2019s fighting at this military base and \u2026 Saudi Arabian bombing. It\u2019s been bombed every night, and it\u2019s very frightening.\u201dHe added, \u201cI don't know if I'm going to make it out of here alive.\u201dFollowing Mobley's call, his legal team Tuesday reached out to the U.S. State Department, urging them to contact Saudi authorities to prevent the Saudi-led bombing campaign from striking the base at which Mobley is held.\u201cIt is now imperative that the U.S. government makes an immediate intervention with Saudi Arabia at the highest level in order to ensure that Saudi forces do not bomb the base, with the high likelihood that Mr. Mobley would be severely injured or killed,\u201d Kat Craig, Reprieve's legal director, said in the letter addressed to the State Department.She added that the presence of civilian prisoners like Mobley would make any such attack a potential war crime.Since his kidnapping, Mobley's attorneys say that they have struggled to obtain even basic information from the U.S. and Yemeni governments concerning his whereabouts.What little information they have obtained has come largely from Freedom of Information Act requests and discreet phone calls made by Mobley using a sympathetic guard\u2019s cell phone.During Monday\u2019s phone call, Mobley told his attorneys that that he was being detained in \u201cthe same prison that the American Embassy visited me at.\u201dHe was referring to a visit by embassy officials in December of last year. \u201cI told them how bad everything was, but they didn't do anything to get me out of here,\u201d he said during the call.Since that visit, the U.S. government has made no contact with Mobley, and in February, the U.S. shuttered its embassy and evacuated its staff due to the deteriorating security situation.In an interview with Al Jazeera, Mobley's wife, Nzingla Islam, said that she had pleaded with the State Department to help her husband escape in January, weeks before the U.S. closed its embassy.Her appeal came after she received a phone call from Mobley that same month, in which he said the Houthis had seized the prison.The State Department eventually responded, saying that no evacuation plans were in place. But a week later in February, the U.S. embassy was abandoned, leaving Mobley with no point of contact.\u201cWe\u2019ve been left in the dark,\" she said.Mobley told his wife during that call in January that he had been beaten several times and was forced to drink out of the same bottle he had previously urinated in.\u201cThe first duty of any government is to protect its citizens,\" said Craig from Reprieve. \u201cThe U.S. knows Sharif\u2019s location and is refusing to do anything to help him. The State Department must give the Saudis the prison coordinates and instruct them not to bomb it. And they must bring their citizen home as soon as possible \u2014 before it is too late.\u201dWith The Associated Press",

    "FREETOWN, Sierra Leone \u2014 Haja Umu Jalloh has not left the room and cordoned-off porch for three weeks. She eats bowls of rice and sauce, slid underneath a nylon rope she cannot cross. She has lost her family \u2014 her parents, her aunt and uncle, her 1-year-old son. But the 17-year-old says defiantly, \"I feel happy because I am protecting others.\"Jalloh defends some 40 orphans at the St. George Foundation Interim Care Center from a terrifyingly invisible enemy, Ebola, which continues to ravage her country. Because of uncertainty about who, among a flood of children orphaned by Ebola, might carry the disease, she has been hired to stand guard just in case. She cares for every new arrival in the roped-off room. As an Ebola survivor, she is considered immune to the disease.This week she shares the room with four other girls. Three of them arrived at St. George after losing their primary caretakers to Ebola. The fourth was discovered alone in the woods outside Freetown, Sierra Leone\u2019s capital. In the past few months, several children entered the orphanage feeling fine, but they became feverish within a week. Ideally, their status would be assured before their arrival \u2014 but the management at St. George is no longer taking chances.",
    "Texas would cut $3 million from programs to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases and spend that money instead on abstinence education under a contentious Republican-sponsored measure tucked into the state budget Tuesday night.The GOP-controlled House overwhelmingly approved the budget amendment, but not before a tense exchange with Democrats that veered into the unusually personal.Republican state Rep. Stuart Spitzer, a doctor and the amendment's sponsor, at one point defended the change by telling the Texas House that he practiced abstinence until marriage. The first-term lawmaker said he hopes schoolchildren follow his example, saying, \"What's good for me is good for a lot of people.\"Democrat state Rep. Harold Dutton asked Spitzer if abstinence worked for him.Shouts of \"Decorum!\" soon echoed on the House floor as Spitzer responded and the back-and-forth intensified. Efforts by Democrats to put the debate in writing for the record \u2014 usually a perfunctory request \u2014 failed.The measure is a long way from final approval. It must still survive budget negotiations with the Senate, although that chamber is equally dominated by conservatives.Texas in 2013 had the third-highest number of HIV diagnoses in the country, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control. Texas also has one of the highest teen birth rates, and its public schools are not required to teach sex education.Another Republican-sponsored amendment that passed Tuesday night would prevent schools from distributing sex education materials from abortion providers.The Associated Press",

    "On March 20, the Michigan Attorney General's Public Integrity Unit charged two U.S. Border Patrol agents with theft and misconduct while on duty. The two agents allegedly stole from a home while executing an agency-authorized search warrant. The case exemplifies the type of unchecked abuse and corruption that has become so rampant within the U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP).From 2010 to 2014 CBP agents  shot and killed 28 people. Other charges against CBP agents included drug trafficking, theft, assaults, kidnapping and rape. Investigative reports from multiple sources paint a picture of a law enforcement agency that is out of control. Even worse, most of its victims are people who cannot fight back \u2014 undocumented immigrants and refugees with limited or no access to U.S. courts.Report after report recounts tales of unchecked abuse of power. Agents frequently respond to cross-border rock throwing with deadly force. Sometimes CBP officers step into the path of moving cars to justify shooting the drivers as a \u201cresponse to deadly force.\u201d The agency has refused to ban either practice, disregarding recommendations from a report that it commissioned. Other kinds of corruption also plague the agency. A 2011 internal study by the CBP found that the agency\u2019s disciplinary system \u201cdoes not foster timely discipline or exoneration.\u201dThe story of failure traces back to 2001. After 9/11, any legislation to protect U.S. borders sailed through Congress. Need more agents? Done. More money? Done. Lawmakers were eager to support border enforcement. In 2003, they merged the previously understaffed Border Patrol with Customs enforcement and Department of Agriculture inspectors to create the CBP. The new agency now has more than 60,000 employees, a $12.4 billion annual budget and a reputation for corruption and abuse. On average, at least one agent is arrested daily for misconduct, according to Politico Magazine\u2019s Garrett M. Graff.What happened was predictable. But no one bothered to consult law enforcement experts. Effective law enforcement requires high standards, careful screening of candidates for criminal backgrounds and for psychological fitness, and intensive training by experienced officers. The rush to fill a lot of vacant positions meant inadequate screening and skimping on training.\u201c[Illegal entry] is now less than a third of what it was in the year 2000, and it\u2019s at its lowest level since the 1970s,\u201d  Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said in October. The estimated number of undocumented immigrants in the United States has dropped by more than a million since 2006. Yet throwing money at CBP remains a way for Congress to boast of protecting borders and getting tough on immigration. The agency continues to grow, with 2,000 new jobs listed in 2014.\u201cFrom an integrity issue, you can\u2019t grow a law enforcement agency that quickly,\u201d Robert Bonner, the former federal judge who headed up CBP\u2019s reorganization, told Politico last year. Not only did the old Border Patrol more than double in size, it also merged employees from customs, immigration and agricultural inspectors.CBP\u2019s record on corruption and abuse is appalling. The Center for Investigative Reporting (CIR) has documented cases of excessive force, drug smuggling, theft and numerous other abuses. \u201cBetween 5 and 10 percent of border agents and officers are actively corrupt or were at some point in their career,\u201d James F. Tomscheck, the former CBP chief of internal affairs, told CIR in August.A 2011 CBP internal study of employee integrity questioned whether the problems could be attributed to the surge in hiring, but acknowledged the severity of the problem. The report attributed the spike in cases of abuse to lack of psychological assessments and ethical training for officers.CBP\u2019s problems start at the top. While Congress was happy to appropriate money for enforcement and more officers, it balked at confirming CBP commissioners, leaving the agency without a confirmed commissioner for five years. The current commissioner, R. Gil Kerlikowske, was confirmed in March 2014. But his authority was undercut from the very beginning.Graff\u2019s article tells the story of a CBP agent who arrested, kidnapped and raped three women from Honduras, and tried to kill two of them. This happened in March 2014, just days after Kerlikowske\u2019s confirmation. The commissioner\u2019s statement condemning the kidnapping and rape was stalled for two days while he argued with senior CBP officials.An agent under his command committed a heinous act. When FBI agents approached the suspect\u2019s apartment, where one of the victims was naked and tied to a chair, the CBP agent shot and killed himself. Yet Kerlikowske\u2019s subordinates prevented him from immediately denouncing the crime.CBP\u2019s defensiveness and disregard for the law appear pervasive. While only a small number of its agents commit violent or criminal acts, indifference to immigrants' legal rights seems to be standard practice across the agency.Border Patrol agents are required by law to ask whether a person they detain is afraid to return home. If migrants express fear of return, the law requires agents to refer them for a \u201ccredible fear\u201d screening by an asylum officer, who can assess eligibility. The law requires referral precisely because CBP agents are not qualified to make eligibility determinations.In case after case, migrants report that CBP agents refused to allow them to tell their stories to an asylum officer. Instead, they tell people fleeing gang violence, rape and persecution that they have no rights.From excessive force and shootings to peremptory denial of access to asylum, the CBP violates the laws it is charged with upholding. Reform is imperative. It should begin with implementation of the recommendations of the 2013 study conducted by the Police Executive Research Forum, ranging from training to prohibition of use of deadly force unless officers\u2019 lives are actually threatened.The second sets of recommendations come from CBP's own internal studies that called for polygraph and psychological testing for all job applicants, and for ethics and integrity training across the agency. A third step would be actual and transparent reporting of misconduct, corruption and disciplinary actions against agents who break the law. Ultimately, respect for the law must begin with those charged with upholding it.",
    "An Indiana judge on Monday sentenced a 33-year-old woman, Purvi Patel, to 20 years in prison on charges of feticide and neglect of a dependent.Patel is the first woman in Indiana to be convicted under the state\u2019s feticide law. Activists say the case highlights the way that prosecutors across the U.S. are increasingly using laws designed to protect expecting mothers to criminalize women for terminating a pregnancy or allegedly harming an unborn child.In 2013, Patel was arrested after seeking help in an emergency room for excessive bleeding, with an umbilical cord protruding from her vagina. She first told staff she hadn\u2019t been pregnant but then revealed that she had given birth at her home in Granger, Indiana, according to court documents.Patel told an investigator that she thought the fetus wasn\u2019t alive and that she left it in a plastic bag in a dumpster outside her family home.A police investigation recovered the fetus and charged Patel with killing her baby.\"I assumed because the baby was dead there was nothing to do,\" the South Bend Tribune, a local newspaper, reported she said in a police interview that was performed just hours after she was admitted to the hospital.\"I've never been in this situation. I've never been pregnant before,\" she allegedly told the police from the hospital while recovering from sedation and blood loss, before she had legal counsel.Reproductive rights advocates say Patel\u2019s case isn\u2019t the first instance in which a woman has been accused under fetal homicide laws.Although the laws were intended to deal with crimes against pregnant women and to target illegal abortion providers, they are increasingly used to prosecute women who miscarry, have stillbirths, try to terminate their own pregnancies or are accused of harming a fetus by taking drugs, according to Sara Ainsworth, legal director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women (NAPW).\u201cWe are gravely concerned that this case represents a trend in punishing pregnant women for their pregnancy outcomes and demonstrates that women will be targeted for terminating their pregnancies, even though abortion opponents routinely claim that if abortion were re-criminalized in the U.S., no pregnant woman would be punished,\u201d she said.Lynn Paltrow, NAPW's executive director, also notes that the charges in Patel's case seem contradictory. \u201cIt\u2019s confusing why a prosecutor would be allowed to bring such contradictory charges,\u201d Paltrow told ThinkProgress. \u201cHow can you both have caused a pregnancy to terminate and given birth to a baby whom you neglect?\u201dA study by NAPW and Fordham University, which documents the arrests of pregnant women in the U.S. since 1973, found that black women and economically disadvantaged women are disproportionately targeted by feticide laws.Indiana's feticide law had only been invoked once before, also a case brought against a woman of color, an immigrant from China. In that case, the woman tried to commit suicide while she was pregnant. She survived, but the baby died, and the woman was charged with feticide. She pled guilty to criminal recklessness after spending more than a year in jail.Patel's case was also controversial for other reasons \u2014 the pathologist who determined that Patel\u2019s fetus was alive used an outdated medical method that involves dipping the lungs in water and seeing whether they float, Slate reported. If they surface, it is taken as proof that the fetus was born alive.Patel told investigators in the hospital interview that she was excited about being pregnant, but text messages and search engine records later showed a jury that she had looked online for abortion-inducing drugs \u2014 misoprostol and mifepristone \u2014 and texted a friend about terminating her pregnancy, the the South Bend Tribune reported.She said she had purchased two drugs from a website in Hong Kong and began taking them in July 2013, according to court documents.A toxicology report, however, revealed no traces of the drugs in Patel\u2019s blood. And Patel's attorney said, according to the South Bend Tribune, that police could find no evidence that the drugs had actually been purchased.Patel\u2019s lawyers said she was afraid to disclose her pregnancy to her parents, who disapproved of extra-marital sex, ThinkProgress reported. Patel\u2019s defense is expected to file an appeal.",
    "In a second evening of violence in Istanbul, police on Wednesday killed a woman carrying a bomb near the city's main police headquarters, a Turkish official said.Istanbul Governor Vasip Sahin also said that a second person escaped and that a policeman was slightly injured. It wasn't immediately clear who was behind the attack.The incident follows a deadly hostage situation on Tuesday, when a prosecutor and two gunmen holding him at an Istanbul courthouse were killed in a shootout between police and the assailants.Following services for the slain prosecutor, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu pledged to track down accomplices, saying the two gunmen were making phone calls abroad during the six-hour standoff.Authorities believe the two assailants belonged to a banned left-wing group, DHKP-C.Davutoglu didn't name the country linked to the phone calls, but said the government would release more information as its investigation went on.\u201cI gave the orders for all sorts of operations against whoever perpetrated the incident, wherever they may be,\u201d Davutoglu said. \u201cNo one should think that the attack will go without a response.\u201d\u201cWe shall find out where the order came from. We will investigate who is behind this network,\u201d he added.The slain prosecutor, Mehmet Selim Kiraz, was investigating the death of a teenager hit by a police gas canister during nationwide anti-government protests in 2013.The hostage-takers had made five demands, including that the police held responsible for the teenager's killing confess to the death and be tried by \u201cpeoples' courts.\u201dPolice in the southern city of Antalya meanwhile, detained 19 people suspected of belonging to DHKP-C, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. The agency said the suspects \u2014 many of them students \u2014 were being interrogated by anti-terrorism police. Ten other suspects were detained in the cities of Izmir and Eskisehir, it said.The DHKP-C, which seeks a socialist state, is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union. The group has carried out sporadic attacks, including a suicide bombing on the U.S. Embassy in 2013 that killed a security guard. The group was more active in the 1970s.Davutoglu, speaking in Istanbul after joining thousands of other mourners for Kiraz's funeral, said the hostage incident aimed to create chaos ahead of Turkey's June 7 general election. He criticized opposition parties for not taking part in the funeral and said the courthouse would be renamed in honor of the prosecutor.Separately, police overpowered an armed man who stormed the ruling party's office in Istanbul, forced employees out and shouted slogans against the party Wednesday. No one was hurt in the incident.The Associated Press",

    "OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 Greg Kloehn builds homes. The California-based artist's best work yet is a classic San Francisco Victorian, complete with a round turret, bay window, and ornate columns framing the small front door. The only catch? The house is 8 feet long, 5 feet wide, 6 feet tall, and constructed from refuse. The columns are carved from two bed posts, and its pitched roof is shingled with rainproof silver coffee bags.But for new parents Dee and Brian, a young homeless couple dealing with a health crisis, the house is perfect.Kloehn \u2014 pronounced like plane \u2014 has built about 30 miniature rolling houses from trash collected in Oakland, each one donated to homeless individuals. After an exhibit of his work at San Francisco art and cultures center SOMArts ended, he offered three of them to people living under the freeway outside the venue. A young man approached and said his sick girlfriend needed a better shelter. When Kloehn helped Brian, 28, roll the house over to Dee, 26, she burst into tears when Kloehn explained that the ornate home was a gift.The Victorian\u2019s safety and added comfort are critical for Dee. She was informed by doctors of a likely leukemia diagnosis when blood clotting complications arose during the birth of their daughter \u2014 who lives with Brian\u2019s relatives \u2014 a week before she met Kloehn. She said if she and Brian relocate, they would give the Victorian to another person surviving on the streets of San Francisco. Their last names were omitted for privacy reasons.\u201cEverything happens for a reason, and we couldn\u2019t have met Greg at a more necessary time,\u201d Dee said with teary eyes.Kloehn\u2019s homes commonly migrate from one person to another after he donates them, which is how 51-year-old DL \u2014 short for the street name \u201cDon\u2019t Lie\" he gave to both Al Jazeera America and Kloehn \u2014 acquired his windowed home, just big enough for him to lie down and sit up in. Though smaller than the neighboring Victorian, DL said his home allows him to \u201cget in touch with normalcy.\u201d\u201cThis is like a hug!\u201d Berkeley resident Elenna Rubin Goodman said as she sat cross-legged inside a tiny house under construction at the Kloehn\u2019s West Oakland studio. \u201cIt gives you containment, which you don\u2019t have on the street. It\u2019s an amazing feeling.\u201dGoodman was one of two people to stop by that morning inquiring if Kloehn was \u201cthe Tiny House Guy.\u201d While Goodman was simply curious, Kloehn\u2019s other visitor, general contractor Garner McAleer, offered Kloehn his unused construction materials.Kloehn has been experimenting in miniature structures since 2009, including a studio apartment he built inside a dumpster, which he uses as his summer home in Brooklyn, New York. The idea to build houses from refuse, however, was inspired by the homeless themselves.\u201cI was just looking at all the structures that homeless people would make,\u201d Kloehn explained. \u201cIt got me looking at their lives: How they\u2019re treated, how they get by, what they live off of. I kind of became enamored by that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a study in life and \u2018What\u2019s a home?\u2019 too,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was a big question I was asking: What does it take to make a home? \u2026 You think of homelessness: Was that around 5,000 years ago? Would you be considered homeless, or could you just make a home? Private property has changed a lot.\u201dAfter completing his first tiny house, Kloehn was visited by Sheila Williams, a familiar face around his neighborhood who has been homeless for 35 years. Knowing Kloehn was always willing to help out, Sheila asked if he could spare a tarp so she and her husband, Oscar Williams, 70, could weather-proof their tent. Kloehn told her to return the next day for something better than a tarp. When they did, he handed them the keys to the tiny home as well as a bottle of champagne.Sheila, 54, a Native American from Yakima, Washington, has assumed the role of den mother for about a dozen people now living in Kloehn houses along Oakland\u2019s Wood Street near the Emeryville border. Nestled amid freeway overpasses, speeding cars, bustling railroads, and trash compacting centers, the tight-knit community has survived adversity \u2014 and even attacks.Sheila\u2019s first home had to be replaced shortly after Kloehn donated it. A passing transient burned the tiny structure down when Oscar refused to share his house \u2014 and wife of over 20 years \u2014 with the stranger. An arsonist also attacked another tiny home on Wood Street that belonged to perhaps the group\u2019s most vulnerable member, Johnny Sastini, who is deaf.Sastini, 59, can neither hear nor speak. He can read lips, and communicates through hand motions or by writing in a notebook. The tiny house Kloehn gave him originally came with a wall-mounted fish tank visible from both inside and outside the house. When an unknown attacker set Sastini's house ablaze, Sheila quickly saved it by smashing the tank.After the fire, Sastini began repeatedly painting his house with different murals \u2014 the Bay Bridge spanning one side wall, shimmering butterflies fluttering up his front door \u2014 in the hope that people would think his home is too beautiful to destroy. He said that local police, who are aware of his auditory and vocal limitations, also help protect his home by checking on it while he works sorting metal at an alloy recycling center.Near the home of Sheila and South Africa-born Oscar is the tiny home of another couple, 47-year-old Terry Kelly and his girlfriend Teresa Morris, who was buzzing with excitement the weekend before her 50th birthday on March 25.The members of the Wood Street community sometimes come together, especially on occasions such as birthdays, for barbecues using charcoal briquettes supplied by Sheila, who also oversees camp cleanliness to maintain good relations with the police. Because their houses are clearly semi-permanent structures, each resident\u2019s bagged trash is now simply collected by trash haulers instead of their whole shelter being swept away as garbage.Kelly has held jobs with two different Oakland homeless programs ended by Alameda County funding cuts. The first, Howie Harp Multi-Service Center, provided showers, laundry, meals and grocery distribution, and educational programs, but was shuttered in 2010. Terry\u2019s next employer, Traveler\u2019s Aid Society, lost its lease in 2011.In 2013, the most recent data available, Alameda County estimated more than 4,200 people were homeless on any given night. East Oakland Community Project Executive Director Wendy Jackson estimates that the actual number is at least 2.5 to 3 times higher, however, because the county\u2019s calculus doesn\u2019t account for people in shelters, hospitals and jails.Laverne, 59, has her own Kloehn house parked a few streets away, but occasionally stays on Wood Street at her boyfriend June Wilson\u2019s house, 67. She became homeless three years ago when she left a husband who mistreated her.Laverne is a graduate of a prestigious East Coast university who still dreamily recalls three months spent traveling through Europe just before she graduated. Her five grown children know where to find her, but have agreed to keep her location and circumstances a secret from their father for her own protection, which is also why she withheld her last name from Al Jazeera America.Laverne expressed a sentiment echoed by many people living in Kloehn\u2019s homes: Homelessness can happen to absolutely anyone, even people who least expect it.\u201cAll this stuff out here can happen to anybody \u2026 no matter what your color is, where you live, or anything,\u201d Laverne said.",
    "Demand for electricity, rather than regional strategic rivalries, may be spurring a number of Arab countries to turn to nuclear power. While much of the world\u2019s attention is locked on Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons ambitions, Jordan for one is quietly inching its domestic energy program toward the nuclear option.Increasingly insecure about its energy dependence on turbulent neighbors such as Iraq and Egypt, Amman last week signed a $10 billion deal with Russian state nuclear agency Rosatom to build its first nuclear power plant in the northern hinterlands of Amra. The 2,000-megawatt plant, Jordan's nuclear chief says, will be \"a showcase for the region\" that could provide up to 50 percent of the kingdom's rapidly growing energy demand \u2013 for household electricity, desalination and industry \u2013 by 2022. Currently, nearly 98 percent of Jordan's energy is met from abroad.The proposal remains highly controversial in Jordan, where all recognize an imminent energy crisis but few are convinced the proposed nuclear plan is a workable solution. After over eight years of inconclusive public debate, however, the country's nuclear commission appears intent on forging ahead. \u201cAs you know, we lost the oil from Iraq, natural gas from Egypt, and the country has been bleeding and losing an average $3 billion every year,\u201d Khalid Toukan, the head of the Jordanian Atomic Energy Commission, told The Associated Press last week. \u201cNuclear power is definitely one of the solutions to graduate from total dependency on oil and gas.\"At a time when several nuclear pioneers, including Germany and France, are currently rolling back their programs and public confidence is still subdued by the memory of the Japan's Fukushima disaster of 2011, atomic energy has seen something of a resurgence across the oil-rich Middle East \u2014 and in the developing world. Though largely overshadowed by the arm-wrestling with Iran (which is mainly about Tehran's right to enrich fuel, not generate nuclear power), a handful of other countries in the region have either begun construction on their first plants or, like Jordan, signaled their intent to do so. Furthest along is the United Arab Emirates, which expects to have two Korean-built plants up and running by 2017.The motives for going nuclear are varied. For oil-rich states like the UAE, nuclear is seen as a high baseload, clean power source that can help meet its growing domestic demand, freeing up oil to be exported and sold at a premium. \u201cThere\u2019s also the prestige element,\u201d added Ali Ahmad, a lecturer on nuclear policy at Princeton University\u2019s Program on Science and Global Security. \u201cHaving a nuclear power plant is a sign of a strong, established and advanced state. The UAE wants to join this club.\u201dNet energy importers such as Jordan, Turkey or Egypt, on the other hand \u2013 all of which have recently inked preliminary nuclear supply deals with Russia \u2013 see the need to diversify energy sources as a security imperative. In the case of Jordan, oil supply routes from Iraq have periodically been cut off since 2003 due to war and, more recently, the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant insurgency. Meanwhile, the gas pipeline from Egypt\u2019s Sinai peninsula, which used to pump 80 percent of Jordan's natural gas, is currently shut due to another insurgency stirring trouble in the region.The Jordanian government has already spent nearly $2 billion in subsidies in order to insulate the public from the fluctuating fuel prices that have resulted from this turmoil. It has little other recourse. When it temporarily eased these subsidies in late 2012, hundreds of thousands of Jordanians took to the streets in the largest public rallies the normally tranquil country has ever seen. And when it began talks with Israel to hammer out a $15 billion natural gas supply deal, many were similarly outraged.But while the need to diversify is clear, few are convinced that Jordan's nuclear program is a viable answer. In a 2013 internal report on Jordan\u2019s nuclear program provided to Al Jazeera, five of Jordan\u2019s leading nuclear policy analysts expressed concerns that the decision to embrace nuclear energy might be driven by \u201cpreconceived notions\u201d rather than sound scientific study.Above all else, it hasn't been made clear how cash-strapped Jordan, which is buckling under the added weight of 700,000 Syrian refugees at the moment, could possibly foot its agreed-upon 51 percent of the bill, let alone manage upgrades to the power grid or cost overruns that nuclear energy is infamous for.\u201cAlmost every existent [nuclear] plant has ended up more expensive than expected in some dimension,\u201d whether operation, maintenance or build cost, said Richard Mallinson, a geopolitical analyst with Energy Aspects in London. \u201cIt\u2019s appealing to go for these big, flagship power plants that can supply half the country\u2019s energy, but even 'turn-key' contracts can end up more costly and slower than expected.\u201dBack when its nuclear program was first presented in 2007, Jordan was hoping that its untapped uranium stores might be mined and sold to cover some of the plant\u2019s steep costs. In 2012, however, French nuclear company Areva determined that the uranium was low in quality and therefore not commercially viable. According to the report, Jordan may even consider tapping into its social security fund to cover some of the program\u2019s costs \u2013 an idea it has not yet presented to an already skeptical public.The last time Jordanian lawmakers voted on the proposal, back in 2012, they decisively shot it down. MPs such as Hind al-Fayez, who represents the Beni Sakher tribe that lives around the proposed Amra site, have noted that Jordan is yet to complete a thorough environmental assessment of the area or to identify a suitable location for depositing spent fuel rods. \"They\u2019ll build that plant over my dead body,\u201d she has said.Ali Ahmad, the Princeton expert who has closely studied Jordan\u2019s nuclear program and met with lawmakers, threw cold water on the proposal. \u201cJordan is far away from constructing a plant,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have an advanced electric grid, they don\u2019t have appropriate legislation or the technical skill base, and one of the biggest problems is that they don\u2019t have an independent regulatory body or safety authority.\u201dAs for nuclear\u2019s future in the wider Middle East, analysts are divided. Industry advocates may pin their hopes on suppliers, such as Russia and South Korea, continuing to subsidize plants in exchange for exclusive supply deals in the long term. That in itself could be cause for concern, critics have noted, especially as Russia seems intent on leveraging energy contracts to extend its political reach. In the case of Jordan, it might also make the United States, which counts the Hashemite kingdom among its closest allies in the region, uneasy.Many, Ahmad among them, believe that solar may be a better long term bet for the sun-drenched Middle East. In a recent analysis on the potential viability of nuclear power in Saudi Arabia, he and co-author M. V. Ramana argued that solar power, while comparatively more expensive today, \u201chas the potential to be cheaper than nuclear power within the next decade if the rapid decline in solar energy costs in the last decade continue.\u201d That, they noted, could happen in the time it takes to build a nuclear plant \u2013 about eight years, under ideal conditions.Given all the hurdles facing nuclear energy in the region, Mallinson said it was important to take announcements like Jordan's with a grain of salt. \"There will always be [a greater number of] countries \u2018exploring\u2019 it or even announcing plans to build than plants that are actually up and running and delivering,\" he said. \u201cNuclear still has that incredible power to divide.\"",
    "This year students and teachers across Pakistan started studying an unusual new subject. In three of the country\u2019s four provinces \u2014 Sindh, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa \u2014 they were taught how to shoot firearms and defuse bombs. The ongoing training was accompanied by the announcement that permit laws have been relaxed to encourage teachers to carry weapons to schools.Both directives are a reaction to the December massacre of 132 schoolchildren at Peshawar\u2019s Army Public School by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The Peshawar attack was intended to avenge the lives taken by the Pakistan army during Zarb-e-Azab, the ongoing military operation in North Waziristan. Zarb-e-Azab was launched as revenge for the TTP\u2019s June assault on Karachi\u2019s Jinnah International Airport \u2014 which was, in turn, a reaction to the killings of TTP leaders such as Hakeemullah Mehsud.This cycle of attack and reprisal is a reminder that the Pakistani state is engaged in a battle with the Pakistani Taliban while civilians continue to pay the price.Instead of devising long-term sociopolitical policies to fight extremism at its roots, the government decided to rely on stopgap solutions. The transfer of responsibility from a weak state to the unqualified shoulders of students and teachers is only the latest example of this shortsighted approach.It is true that long-term solutions require increasing short-term security. This is why schools across the country were shut down after the Peshawar attack. But the government failed to use this period to implement the concrete security policies that it should have put in place. Security experts should have come forth and overseen the installation of closed-circuit television cameras and panic buttons that could improve state security personnel\u2019s response time to threats. The government should have begun recruiting and training security guards exclusively for the purpose of defending and monitoring schools. The impact of the Peshawar attack was such that if the relevant parties had attempted sincere cooperation, it would have been possible to obtain a sufficient budget to pay for these improvements.Instead, when schools reopened after this extended break, their budgets were so constrained that, as one provincial minister admitted, the construction of boundary walls for thousands of schools could be paid for only by diverting $15 million that had been earmarked for school sanitary facilities and drinking water.Mushtaq Ahmed Ghani, the interior and higher education minister for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, claims that the new directives could eliminate further attacks on schools because the Taliban would not want to face armed teachers. Unfortunately, he is talking about the same Taliban who have been brazen enough to attack the Pakistan army headquarters, Pakistan\u2019s naval base and heavily barricaded prisons. It is ludicrous to think that these hardened militants will be scared off by inexperienced teachers who can hardly handle the weight \u2014 much less the recoil \u2014 of a gun.Ghani also claims that the training will be particularly effective during the approximately 10 minutes it takes security agencies to arrive at a school under attack. Schools in Pakistan have been under siege for the better part of a decade; in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa alone, at least 750 schools have been attacked by militants since 2008. Although not all attacks have the same motivations as the Peshawar massacre, the government has still had ample time to create policy measures to protect educational institutions. Requiring teachers to hold the front for 10 minutes while awaiting security forces reveals the government\u2019s utter failure to develop effective policies.For years now, schools and colleges that can afford it have been making their boundary walls higher and covering them with barbed wire. The richest schools even hire snipers on occasions when the security situation seems more volatile than usual. It is hardly ideal to educate young minds inside schools that resemble forts, but it is far more unsettling to expect children to concentrate on algebra while fully aware that their teacher has a loaded gun \u2014 and that their classmates or perhaps they themselves, have the ability to use that gun.Perhaps the most unnerving part of this story is the reaction that the new directives have received. Although a sample of 1,371 people is hardly representative of Pakistan, the results of a poll carried out by the English-language newspaper Dawn are suggestive. When it asked readers of its website if providing security training to students was a good idea, 64 percent said yes.It is only fitting, then, that Herald magazine\u2019s most recent person of the year, by popular vote, is Aitzaz Hasan \u2014 a schoolboy from Hangu who died tackling a suicide bomber to save the lives of scores of other students. Hasan was a hero who acted on instinct, and his bravery should be applauded. But we cannot ask more Pakistani students to live up to this individual act of courage. Parents should be sending children to school to learn, not to enter the battle against terrorism.For further arguments against the government\u2019s pro-gun policies, take the case of Niaz Muhammad, a school security guard in Mansehra who accidently shot and injured four 10-year-old girls while they were entering school, or Salim Masih, a low-ranking office worker who was handed a submachine gun to unwillingly protect a school in Peshawar after merely a day of training.Handing out guns to undertrained school staffers and students is not an antidote to the Taliban. On the contrary, it will set Pakistan\u2019s battle against extremism many steps back. The stakes are high: Years ago, a similarly careless distribution of weapons played a critical part in creating the militants Pakistan is battling today. Until the government starts to fight the roots of militancy instead of its symptoms, the current cycle of violence is likely to continue.",
    "U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and his German and French counterparts extended marathon talks in Switzerland on Wednesday for a second day beyond a self-imposed deadline to reach a preliminary agreement with Iran on its nuclear program.A diplomat close to the talks said late Wednesday that a deal could be announced within hours but had not yet been reached, and the talks could still collapse.Kerry and German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier announced they would stay at least until Thursday. In a potentially hopeful sign, French Foreign Secretary Laurent Fabius returned for more talks after flying back to Paris the previous day because progress had been too slow.Negotiations over Iran's nuclear program had resumed on Wednesday after a self-imposed deadline extended past Tuesday night, but the talks were almost immediately beset by competing claims \u2014 just hours after diplomats abandoned a March 31 deadline to reach the outline of a deal.The negotiators' intention is to produce a joint statement outlining general political commitments to resolve concerns about the Iranians' nuclear program, in exchange for relief of economic sanctions against Iran. Negotiators are also trying to fashion other documents that would lay out in more detail the steps they must take by June 30 to meet those goals.But Iran has pushed back, demanding a general statement with few specifics. That is politically unpalatable for the Obama administration, which must convince a hostile Congress that it has made progress in the talks so lawmakers do not enact new sanctions that could destroy the negotiations.By blowing through self-imposed deadlines, Obama risks further antagonizing lawmakers in both parties who are poised to take their own action to upend a deal if they determine the president has been too conciliatory.Republicans\u2019 initial response to the extensions suggested they had already come to that conclusion.\"It is clear, the negotiations are not going well,\" said Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham in a statement. \"At every step, the Iranians appear intent on retaining the capacity to achieve a nuclear weapon.\u201dIran's Zarif insisted that the result of this round of talks \"will not be more than a statement.\" But a senior Western official said Iran's negotiating partners would not accept a document that contained no details. The official was not authorized to speak about the negotiations by name, and spoke on condition of anonymity.The U.S. and its negotiating partners are demanding curbs on Iranian nuclear activities that could be used to make weapons, and they say any agreement must extend the time Tehran would need to produce a weapon from the present several months to at least a year. The Iranians deny such military intentions, but they are negotiating with the aim that a deal will end sanctions on their economy.Al Jazeera and wire services",
    "SUNRISE MANOR, Nev. \u2014 On the outskirts of Las Vegas, the full array of U.S. airpower is on display at Nellis Air Force Base \u2014 from proven workhorses like the F-15 and F-16 to more modern aircraft like the F-22.Parked alongside the runway, you\u2019ll also find the latest addition to America\u2019s military arsenal. Billed as the future of manned airpower in the U.S., the F-35 is a product of the most expensive weapons program in U.S. history. According to one Pentagon report, the price tag will reach $1.4 trillion.The Pentagon has bought about 150 F-35s, even though the plane isn\u2019t cleared for combat \u2014 in military speak, operationally capable. Eventually, the Air Force is expected to buy more than 1,700 F-35s, with the Navy and Marine Corps purchasing nearly 700 more F-35s modified for them.Congress and the military believe the F-35, manufactured by defense giant Lockheed Martin, can be tested and refined as planes continue to come off the assembly line. The Pentagon calls this concurrency. From its futuristic shape to the millions of lines of computer code that act as a kind of artificial intelligence, the plane is a complicated beast.\u201cI can say the F-35 is a monumental leap in capability,\u201d said Air Force Lt. Col. Benjamin Bishop, a pilot and one of the senior Air Force commanders testing the new plane for battle. \u201cYou don\u2019t really get in it. You strap it on.\u201dFrom a military man, that might be what you\u2019d expect to hear. But the F-35 project has been so plagued by design flaws and technical setbacks that rarely a week goes by without a negative headline. A few weeks ago, a report written by J. Michael Gilmore, director of the Pentagon\u2019s operational test and evaluation office (DOT&E), detailed so many problems that one defense industry publication called the F-35 \u201ca hot mess.\u201dIn his report, the DOT&E talks about the results of live fire tests, which involve taking pieces of the airplane and shooting at them with ammunition.According to Pierre Sprey, a former Pentagon analyst who helped design the F-16 in the early 1970s, what those tests revealed was bad.\u201cThere are fuel tanks all the way through the wing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are fuel tanks through the fuselage. And the worst places that they cram fuel [are] around the inlets and back toward the engine. Think of this engine as a blowtorch surrounded by fuel. That\u2019s what it really is.\u201dTo this day, test pilots at Nellis and on other bases are operating under severe restrictions, unable to fly the plane at high speed or maneuver aggressively, for fear the engine problem could happen again. According to the DOT&E, \u201ca final design\u201d to fix the engine problem was \u201cnot complete\u201d at the time the report was written.Major Gen. Jay Silveria commands the Air Force Warfare Center at Nellis. His unit oversees what\u2019s known as operational testing of the F-35 for the Air Force \u2014 in other words, seeing how it might perform in battle. He was just returning from a test flight when we met him earlier this month.\u201cWe have a long history of a sound, safe program,\u201d said Silveria, who has clocked 50 hours on the F-35. \u201cI have no safety concerns, and since I fly the plane, I have to pay personal attention to those safety concerns.\u201dWhen asked about how the F-35\u2019s problems may be affecting his ability to test it, he conceded that he\u2019s facing \u201climitations.\u201d He added, \u201cWe are slowly working through [them], expanding the operational envelope of the plane.\u201dAccording to Silveria, the F-35 process of concurrency is working.\u201cWe take it and put it in operationally representative conditions. So when I put it in those conditions, I learn how it acts in combat,\u201d he said. \u201cI learn things about the plane, so we will find things.\u201d\u201cI see a program that should have been held up,\u201d said Tom Christie, who was the Pentagon\u2019s director of operational test and evaluation from 2001 to 2005. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to take your time and wring this thing out before you start delivering these aircraft and [not] have to go back and spend billions fixing them.\u201dDespite all the problems \u2014 both those discovered and those still unknown \u2014 the Marine Corps is expected to declare its version of the F-35 operationally capable this summer. Christie called that decision \u201ca sham.\u201d\u201cThe program has been embarrassing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re just at the point to say, \u2018We\u2019re going to take whatever we get.\u2019\u201dThe Air Force plans to declare its version fit for combat in late 2016. The Navy plans to do the same in 2019."
