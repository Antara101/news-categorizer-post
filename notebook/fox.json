    "Sign in to comment!They were king and queen of their homemade castle, but now a city in Utah is threatening to impose heavy fines and even a lien on the family home if they don\u2019t tear it down.Jeremy Trentelman built a cardboard castle for his kids, who are 2 and 3 years old, in their front yard.Last week, though, Trentelman reportedly received a letter from Ogden City Code Enforcement officials stating that the castle was violating city code -- which prohibits people from putting junk in their yards.Trentelman has 15 days to take the castle down, or faces a $125 penalty.Trentelman posted a response on his Facebook page: \u201cARE YOU FREAKIN KIDDIN ME!!!?!\u201dHe later told KUTV, \u201cThey can also file criminal charges against us and levy the fines as a lien against the house. So they're not playing.\u201dOgden code prohibits people from leaving \u201cjunk or salvage material\u201d on their lawn, which could pose as a fire or safety hazard.Trentelman said had he not received the demand to dismantle the fort, he would have taken it down in a few days anyway. But after getting the warning from Ogden, he says he will keep Casa Castle up until just before the penalty.\u201cIt was a great project for all of us to build, and now it\u2019s just (fun) watching them play in it, and watching their imagination run wild is just fantastic,\u201d Trentelman told The Salt Lake Tribune.The Trentelmans' standoff with the Ogden officials has prompted other residents in the area to build cardboard forts in their yards, too, as well as join a Facebook protest. As of Sunday, 64 people had joined the online show of solidarity, according to The Tribune.Calls to Ogden city officials by FoxNews.com were not immediately returned.51%47%13%75%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

    "Instead of enjoying a tax refund this year, you are surprised to find that you owe Uncle Sam. Even worse, you do not have the money to pay these surprise taxes. What can you do?One thing you definitely do not want to do is ignore the tax bill. That will only make your situation worse in the long run as you rack up fees and penalties. Make sure that you file your taxes on time and choose one of the following options.Loans/Credit \u2013 Depending on the size of the tax bill, it may make sense to take out a loan (if you can qualify) or pay the tax bill via credit card. You will have to estimate when you can expect to pay the bill, and do a cost-benefit analysis on whether the interest you will pay on the credit card or loan is greater than the potential penalties that you would pay the IRS for a delayed or partial payment.Do not forget to include the fees associated with paying taxes by credit card with an approved vendor (generally 1.88% of the transaction).Apply for A Short Extension \u2013 You can fill out the Online Payment Agreement application on the IRS website to stretch out your debt repayment over 60-120 days, or you can call the IRS directly to make the same request. By contacting the IRS, setting up the extension, and paying what you can before the deadline, you will minimize the penalties and interest that you owe.Before making the final payment, contact the IRS to verify the correct amount of accrued interest, especially if you are paying before the end of the extension. Do not wait on a bill from the IRS.Request Installment Payment \u2013 If you need more than 120 days to pay your bill, consider using IRS Form 9465-FS, \u201cInstallment Agreement Request\u201d to set up a payment plan. There will be a fee to set up the plan and after that point you will pay the bill in monthly increments that you set up \u2014 assuming the IRS approves your plan. Your payment plan must not stretch out the payments for more than three years.File Form 9465 as early as possible because it may take up to thirty days for the IRS to let you know if it has been approved.Ask For a Hardship Extension \u2013 If you qualify for an extension due to financial hardship, you can file Form 1127-A with the IRS before the filing deadline to claim an extension of up to six months. Hardship cases require showing a substantial financial loss if the tax is paid on time (for example, having to sell property at a sacrificial loss). A prolonged period of unemployment may qualify.The IRS does not consider a mere inconvenience worthy of a hardship, and you will have to explain why borrowing the money is not a viable option for you. You must supply a statement of assets and liabilities at the end of the previous month prior to filing the form, and list all income and expenses for the prior three months. If you have enough advance warning, we suggest contacting the IRS first to see if you are likely to qualify for a hardship situation.In general, your best bet to limit the damage is to contact the IRS before the filing date and pay whatever you can at the regular filing deadline to minimize the damage. Investigate the options above to see which one best fits your situation, and do not ignore the problem. Do not expect the IRS to just go away and leave you alone. It won\u2019t happen.More from MoneyTips.comThe Punishing Costs of Paying Your Taxes Late\nFinancial Benefits of Investing Your Tax Refund\nTax Day Last Minute Filing+ FollowFox Business on FacebookMore\u203aInvesting\u203a",

    "Sign in to comment!April 6, 2015: President Obama reads \"Where the Wild Things Are\" by Maurice Sendak, during the White House Easter Egg Roll on the South Lawn of the White House is Washington.\u00a0(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)A flying, buzzing harbinger of spring briefly upstaged President Barack Obama at the annual White House Easter egg roll Monday.Squeals and shrieks from a clump of agitated children interrupted Obama's reading of his childhood favorite, Maurice Sendak's \"Where the Wild Things Are,\" at the storytime stage, one of several outdoor stations at an event that has grown into far more than colored eggs.Obama looked up to see what the trouble was.\"Oh no, it's a bee!\" he said, laughing, then quickly tried to reassure the kids. \"That's OK guys, bees are good. They won't land on you. They won't sting you.\"In fact, helping honeybees and other beleaguered pollinators survive is a goal of Obama's administration. Elsewhere at the event, children were given donated Burpee garden seeds to encourage them to plant bee-friendly habitats.But the kids ducking and dodging in their hay-bale seats had no interest in being part of this bee's habitat. \"Scary!\" one of them shouted.Obama -- who had just led the children through imitations of the roaring, teeth-gnashing and eye-rolling of the storybook's monsters, finally got them settled down after a reminder that, \"You're not supposed to be scared of bees when you're Wild Things.\"Officials said more than 35,000 people took part in the 137th egg roll, an event that began when President Rutherford B. Hayes opened the White House grounds to local children for egg rolling in 1878.Toddler boys in straw fedoras and little girls in spring dresses with bright sashes romped on the lawn. One girl, in pants, turned cartwheels while waiting her turn to roll a wooden egg.Eleven-year-old Madison Knight, decked out in sequined rabbit ears, said she'd never heard of egg rolling before -- only egg hunting -- but was game to try the White House tradition.Madison and her 9-year-old friend Kyla Newkirk, both from Durham, North Carolina, agreed that wasn't the most exciting part of the day, however. Their anticipated highlight? \"Seeing the president!\" Madison said, as she waited for Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and a giant Easter Bunny to emerge on the South Portico to officially start the day.The egg roll tradition involves children lining up to use wooden spoons to push the brightly painted eggs a short distance across the grass, in a loosely defined race to the finish line. It's harder than it sounds -- especially for toddlers -- and strategies range from nudging, poking and sideswiping the eggs to a scooping motion that sometimes sends them flying in unexpected directions.The Obamas stopped by to give encouragement. Michelle Obama leaned over to gently help one youngster get his egg moving again in mid-race. Obama offered high-fives, handshakes and hugs to kids and their parents. \"Good job, guys,\" he said.The Obamas used the event to tout the fifth anniversary of the first lady's campaign to get kids to eat well and exercise. The girl group Fifth Harmony appeared with a not-so-healthy-looking cake to sing \"Happy Birthday\" to the \"Let's Move!\" effort.This year, the (hash)GimmeFive theme was added, encouraging children to come up with five ways live healthier lives and to share them on social media.Making his rounds, Obama joined kids shooting baskets with Washington Wizards players and other athletes, missing his first shot but sinking the second.Then he took on tennis star Caroline Wozniacki in a doubles game with kids on a mini-court. Obama whooped when he scored against the Danish pro.\"Got to work on those volleys,\" he teased, adding, \"I'm a competitor.\"Then she served, and the president missed the return.45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

    "Sign in to comment!The Supreme Court won't hear an appeal from a former government subcontractor seeking to sue the U.S. government for negligence over his five-year imprisonment in Cuba.The justices on Monday let stand a federal appeals court ruling that threw out Alan Gross' $60 million lawsuit blaming the federal government for failing to prepare him for the risks of working in Cuba.Gross was freed in December as the U.S. announced it would re-establish diplomatic relations with Cuba. He was working as a U.S. Agency for International Development subcontractor in Cuba when he was arrested in 2009.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled last year that the U.S. government is immune from claims arising in a foreign country.In a separate case, Gross received $3.2 million in December from the federal government as part of a settlement with the Maryland-based company he worked for at the time of his arrest.The USAID said it paid Gross to settle claims pending before the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals for unanticipated claims under a cost-reimbursement contract with Development Alternatives Inc. of Bethesda, Maryland.The USAID said the settlement was not an admission of liability, but was intended to avoid the costs and risks of further legal proceedings.45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

    "Sign in to comment!By Laura CoburnFile photo.\u00a0(REUTERS/Kacper Pempel)Jonah Bernstein\u2019s grandfather was a WW II veteran who spoke more than 40 languages, had a photographic memory and endless stories to tell. After his stroke he could never speak again. \u201cThere was just nothing we could do,\u201d Bernstein recounts.That\u2019s why at the age of 15, Bernstein decided he would dedicate his career to finding a way to help stroke victims. After completing his MBA at Harvard Business School, Bernstein partnered with Alex Turjman, a PhD from MIT in vascular biology, to found Cognition Medical. Together they created a device that reduces brain damage from strokes by almost 40 percent.They already have a prototype, a patent, and a team of leading physicians and advisors from MIT, Harvard and Medtronic. But they\u2019re heading to Atlanta for the next big step \u2013 bringing their idea to market.Cognition Medical is one the few companies selected from across the globe to meet in Atlanta to incubate their ideas through NeuroLaunch, the first and only accelerator program in the world specifically for neuroscience technology startups. The 90-day program provides its participating companies with seed funding, access to top research facilities, and mentorship from professionals in Atlanta\u2019s neuroscience and software startup scenes. The goal: kick start a hub for neuro-technology in Atlanta and transform neuro-tech ideas into high impact products.Neuroscience is one of the final unexplored frontiers in medical research. More than 5 million Americans suffer from debilitating neurological conditions, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease and stroke. Taking strides to decode the complex neural system, in 2013 President Obama launched the White House BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) Initiative, which aims to revolutionize understanding of the human brain. By 2015, the program will invest more than $200 million to fund new research in neuroscience. With new technology and a cohesive neuroscience technology hub, there could soon be major research discoveries and groundbreaking technological developments.\u201cWe believe that technological solutions are going to play a large role in treating patients,\u201d NeuroLaunch Co-Founder and Emory University Neurosurgery Resident Dr. Jordan Amadio said. \u201cBut these technologies need to come to market. They can\u2019t remain as ideas in the laboratory without being translated.\u201dAtlanta has all the right elements to advance the selected companies and create a successful neuroscience startup hub, according to Amadio, who came to Atlanta for his neurosurgery residency. Atlanta is home to world-renowned health care and neuroscience institutions. These include Emory University and Georgia State University, two of the top neuroscience research universities. Georgia Tech is a top-five engineering school with its graduate bio-medical engineering program ranked second in the country, according to U.S. News & World Report. The city also houses the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Shepherd Center for spinal cord and brain rehabilitation, and multiple leading hospitals.With these institutions come leaders that specialize in both neuroscience and tech development. NeuroLaunch provides guidance from over 50 world-class mentors who have vast experience in neuroscience and entrepreneurship. These mentors include experts in engineering, law, business, policy and science.We\u2019re a hub that has not been marketed as a hub,\u201d said NeuroLaunch Co-Founder and angel investor Christopher Klaus. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some of the top neuroscientists in the country in our own backyard but nobody knows about it.\u201dWhile there are currently biotech startups springing up in other cities, these hubs tend to have specific focuses. NeuroLaunch Co-Founder and Georgia Tech graduate Jim Schwoebel says that Boston, for example, is better known for pharmaceutical developments, while San Francisco is more known for neuroscience devices.But when choosing finalists for NeuroLaunch, the four co-founders were not searching for any one type of neuroscience company. Instead, Amadio says they sought to bring a variety of neuroscience innovations under one roof.\u201cWe\u2019re not limiting ourselves,\u201d Amadio said. \u201cThere\u2019s a commonality between all these individuals trying to develop new innovations in neuroscience - whether it\u2019s a medical device, neurosurgical device, drug, software application, consumer product or a toy.\u201dBeyond neuroscience, Atlanta is already emerging as a regional hub for software startups. Angel investors scout companies in Atlanta, particularly in the cyber security, marketing and finance niches, according to Klaus, who founded Atlanta-based Internet Security Systems, which was sold to IBM for $1.3 billion in 2006. The neuroscience innovators can tap into this established network of software startups across Atlanta to translate their research into functional technology.Besides a rapidly growing tech startup scene, Atlanta has affordable real estate, making it an inexpensive place to grow a business in comparison to other startup hubs like Boston, Silicon Valley or New York. Klaus says that it\u2019s much more economical to start a company and hire engineers in the southeast.And Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport allows experts from all over the world to easily fly into the city to do business. The airport is the busiest in the world and offers service to nearly 80 international destinations in more than 50 countries. NeuroLaunch has accepted and is flying in companies from Spain and the Netherlands for the accelerator.Amadio hopes that NeuroLaunch will be a catalyst to grow the neuroscience startup community in Atlanta and contribute to a worldwide initiative to decode the brain.\u201cI would love to see the accelerator model spread well beyond NeuroLaunch,\u201d he explained. \u201cI hope NeuroLaunch is the first example of a cultural movement within neuroscience over the next ten years, where this becomes increasingly popular as a way for innovators to bring their innovations to the marketplace.\u201dThe founders of Cognition Medical say they most look forward to learning about entrepreneurship and gaining both a strong network and financial support in Atlanta. But most importantly, they say they hope to raise awareness about extremely important neurologic issues. And Klaus sees these hopes as entirely attainable.\u201cThere are seven billion customers on the planet,\u201d he told FoxNews.com. \u201cAs long as there\u2019s humans on the planet with brains, we\u2019ve got a huge opportunity ahead of us. We\u2019re just at the beginning stages of understanding the brain, and the companies are truly coming up with ways to add value to neuroscience.\u201cLaura Coburn is a student in the Fox News Campus Associate Program.\nGet more information on the program here.",

    "Sign in to comment!By James RogersEric Schadt.\u00a0(Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology at Mount Sinai)Eric Schadt, director of the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology at Mount Sinai in New York was thrust into the tech spotlight last month after launching an Asthma Health app with Apple.The Asthma Health app was one of a number of medical research apps unveiled during Apple's glitzy \u201cSpring Forward\u201d event. Using the tech giant's new ResearchKit open source software framework, the app aims to make it easy for asthma sufferers to participate in research studies via their iPhones.Schadt was thrilled with the level of interest generated by launch, telling FoxNews.com that 2,500 people downloaded the app and enrolled in the study on the launch day alone.The Apple partnership, while generating plenty of buzz, is just the latest of Schadt\u2019s innovative research efforts. The mathematician and computational biologist is also leading the Resilience Project, a massive study led by the Icahn School of Medicine and Sage Bionetworks.The project, described as \u201ca search for unexpected heroes,\u201d was launched in 2014, and aims to boost scientific knowledge of genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis. The Resilience Project\u2019s ultimate goal is to crunch DNA data from more than a million people.\u201cWe\u2019re doing a screen on a million-plus individuals who carry the mutations, but don\u2019t have the disease \u2013 our view is that these individuals carry far more insight into the disease,\u201d said Schadt. \u201cFinding out why they are protected against the disease could be a therapeutic that is provided to other people.\u201dSome 5,000 people are already signed up for the project, and Schadt hopes to push this number up to 50,000 by the end of 2015. \u201cOur hope is that through 2016, we get into the hundreds of thousands,\u201d he added.The Resilience Project estimates that one person in 20,000 or less, although living a normal healthy life, possesses the genetic mutation that would typically cause severe disease.\u201cWe did a retrospective Resilience Project where we looked at 600,000 genomes that we got from a variety of sources, for example, [DNA service] 23andme,\u201d\u00a0 said Schadt.The first phase of the project, which examines healthy adults of 30 and above, looks at diseases that would typically have manifested themselves in childhood.The high-tech research work undertaken by Schadt and his team has already won plaudits. Last year Fast Company ranked the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai as no. 5 in its top 10 ranking of the world\u2019s most innovative companies in big data.Fast Company cited Mount Sinai\u2019s success in \u201cembracing data scientists and supercomputers to build the hospital of the future,\u201d specifically its $3 million Minerva supercomputer and its BioMe database of genomic samples.Prior to joining Mount Sinai in 2011, Schadt was chief scientific officer at Pacific Biosciences. Earlier in his career, he was executive scientific director of genetics at Merck subsidiary Rosetta Inpharmatics and senior research scientist at Roche Bioscience.The intersection of technology and genetics has been a source of interest throughout Schadt\u2019s career. In particular, he noticed a slew of interesting technologies when completing his Ph.D. in bio-mathematics at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cWhat I saw coming out of my Ph.D in 98 and 99 was this wave of technologies that would enable us to take way better snapshots,\u201d he told FoxNews.com. \u201cThe first commercially available gene chips \u2013 all of the genes being transcribed and transferred to proteins could be looked at commercially for the first time.\u201d\u201cA lot of it is my background \u2013 I have always been a tech lover,\u201d he added. \u201cI have always embraced the current technologies that enable us to take better snapshots of living systems.\u201dFollow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers",

    "Sign in to comment!Did defense do enough to spare Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's life?BOSTON \u2013 \u00a0As he planted a backpack containing a bomb near a group of children, Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev made a coldblooded decision aimed at spreading terror and punishing America for its wars in Muslim countries, a federal prosecutor told the jury during closing arguments Monday at Tsarnaev's death penalty trial.\"There was nothing about this day that was a twist of fate,\" Aloke Chakravarty said. \"This was a cold, calculated terrorist act. This was intentional. It was bloodthirsty. It was to make a point. It was to tell America that 'We will not be terrorized by you anymore. We will terrorize you.'\"Defense attorney Judy Clarke countered by arguing, as she did at the trial's outset, that Tsarnaev took part in the attack but did so under the malevolent influence of his now-dead older brother, Tamerlan. Clarke repeatedly referred to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev \u2014 then 19 \u2014 as a \"kid\" and a \"teenager.\"\"If not for Tamerlan, it would not have happened,\" Clarke said.The jury is expected to begin deliberating Tuesday morning in the case against Tsarnaev, 21, almost two years after the twin bombings near the finish line of the Boston Marathon killed three people and wounded more than 260. It was the nation's deadliest terror attack since 9/11.If Tsarnaev is convicted \u2014 and that is considered a near certainty, given his lawyer's admission \u2014 the jury will then begin hearing evidence on whether he should get life in prison or a death sentence.Prosecutors used their closing argument to remind the jury of the horror of that day, showing photographs and video of the carnage and chaos after the shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bombs exploded. In one video, jurors could hear the agonizing screams of Krystle Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager who bled to death on the sidewalk. Another woman and an 8-year-old boy were also killed.Taking aim at the argument that Tsarnaev was led astray by his older brother, Chakravarty repeatedly referred to the Tsarnaevs as \"a team\" and \"partners\" in the attack.\"That day, they felt they were soldiers. They were the mujahedeen, and they were bringing their battle to Boston,\" the prosecutor said.As for the youngsters killed or maimed by the bomb that was in Dzhokhar's backpack, Chakravarty said: \"These children weren't innocent to him. They were American. Of all the places that he could have placed the bomb, he placed it right there.\"Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died four days after the bombings after he was shot by police and run over by Dzhokhar during a getaway attempt. Dzhokhar was captured hiding in a dry-docked boat.At the end of his closing argument, Chakravarty displayed photos of the those killed in the bombings and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer who was shot to death during the getaway attempt.\"They are no longer with us,\" Chakravarty said. \"This is the result of the defendant's choice to be a terrorist, his choice to make a statement. These were choices that he was proud of.\"Clarke struck a conciliatory tone in her closing argument, admitting the attack brought \"tragedy, suffering and grief in dimensions that none of us could imagine were possible.\"But in a strategy clearly aimed at saving Tsarnaev from the death penalty, Clarke said Tamerlan played a much more prominent role, buying bomb components, including pressure cookers, BBs and remote control parts. She said Tamerlan researched via computer how to build the bombs and planned the attack.

So they're not playing.\u201dOgden code prohibits people from leaving \u201cjunk or salvage material\u201d on their lawn, which could pose as a fire or safety hazard.Trentelman said had he not received the demand to dismantle the fort, he would have taken it down in a few days anyway. But after getting the warning from Ogden, he says he will keep Casa Castle up until just before the penalty.\u201cIt was a great project for all of us to build, and now it\u2019s just (fun) watching them play in it, and watching their imagination run wild is just fantastic,\u201d Trentelman told The Salt Lake Tribune.The Trentelmans' standoff with the Ogden officials has prompted other residents in the area to build cardboard forts in their yards, too, as well as join a Facebook protest. As of Sunday, 64 people had joined the online show of solidarity, according to The Tribune.Calls to Ogden city officials by FoxNews.com were not immediately returned.45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

    "Sign in to comment!By Ruth RavveIllinois workers file lawsuit to end mandatory union duesThe future of public and private unions in two big labor-friendly states may be at stake as foes mount aggressive legal challenges over the long-controversial practice of mandatory dues.The court cases in Illinois and California revolve around so-called \"fair share\" payments, or the dues unions extract from workers whose jobs stand to benefit from collective bargaining -- whether or not the workers are technically union members. Unions argue workers should have to pay their \"fair share\" of the costs of negotiating and administering a union contract, so they\u2019re not getting a free ride from the union\u2019s efforts.But workers are often surprised to see money taken from their paychecks, without their consent.\u201cI really found out about it when I got my first paycheck and there was the fair share that was pulled out,\u201d said Mark Janus, who works as a child support specialist with the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services.The fees taken out of Janus\u2019 check amounted to about $46 a month, every month, for the eight years he\u2019s been on the job.\u00a0\u201cI figured I\u2019d paid over $4,000 so far,\u201d he said. The money Janus unintentionally paid went to the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, also known as AFSCME, which represents employees in his office.Janus is now one of three plaintiffs who have joined with Republican Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner in a lawsuit to overturn the state's so-called fair share law.\u201cI don't feel that the union represents me 100 percent in what I believe and what I like to do,\u201d Janus explained. \u201cAnd nobody asked me if I wanted to join the union, they just said 'here's a job, you're in the union.'\"The intention of the lawsuit is to get a federal judge in Chicago, and ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court, to declare the fee for non-member dues unconstitutional.In addition, Rauner issued an executive order with the same purpose.\u201cThis is a fundamental issue protecting employees\u2019 rights, their freedom of speech, and their rights as employees,\u201d Rauner said.But Tim Drea, the Illinois AFL-CIO secretary treasurer, said \u201call state employees benefit from what the unions do on wages and bargaining ... health care and pension benefits.\u201dWhile the fair share law requires that no money raised from the fees be used by the unions for political purposes, Rauner said that\u2019s not possible when it comes to a state employees union.\u201cBy their very nature government political activities are political. They\u2019re inside the government and advocating with politicians, so by definition it\u2019s all political,\u201d Rauner told Fox News.On the West Coast, a similar battle is taking place that some claim could put an end to the teachers' union.In Friedrich v. California Teachers\u2019 Association, 10 teachers filed suit over a state law requiring dues to the union they don\u2019t support.\u00a0The teachers said the law violates their constitutional rights.The fair-share labor law was formed as a result of a 1977 court case called Abood v. The Detroit Board of Education. In that case, public school teachers in Detroit sought to overturn a requirement that they pay dues to the teachers' union on the grounds they didn\u2019t support the union activities or collective bargaining.The court sided with the unions and determined that non-members can be charged fees, though the money from fees could not be used for political purposes.Since that decision came down, about half the states in the U.S. -- the ones that are not right-to-work states -- require workers in union-backed jobs who don\u2019t want to join a union to pay their \u201cfair share.\u201dIn the Midwest, where auto workers, Teamsters and other unions have had a stronghold for years, the right-to-work plan has been met with massive protests and multiple court battles -- yet right-to-work laws have passed in Michigan, Wisconsin and Indiana.Now that battle lines are being draw in Illinois, the Land of Lincoln state may become the last stand in America\u2019s heartland for the unions.\u00a0Without a policy of mandatory dues, unions anywhere stand to lose revenue and members.\u201cIn half the other states in the U.S., government workers have a right to choose whether they will give money to a union. In Illinois, government workers don't have the right to make that choice,\u201d said Jacob Huebert, an attorney for the Liberty Justice Center, which is representing plaintiffs in the Illinois lawsuit.Huebert said he\u2019s encouraged to test the issue because of the court\u2019s response to another challenge to the union dues requirement by an Illinois woman named Pam Harris.Harris didn\u2019t want to have to pay dues to a state workers union just because she\u2019d taken on a job as home health care worker for her mentally and physically disabled son. The Supreme Court ruled that Harris was not a state employee and therefore didn\u2019t have to pay dues.As part of its opinion in the Harris case, the court stated that the Abood decision may not withstand a challenge. The Liberty Justice Center was inspired to mount that challenge.Labor leaders, who plan to \u201cmount a vigorous defense\u201d to the lawsuits, claim opponents are just trying to weaken and choke off unions in general, especially in Illinois where negotiations for a new contract are taking place.Drea said he feels confident the court will rule in favor of the fair-share decision, but he worries the continuous battle resulting in right-to-work states \u201cis just a further continuation of the race to the bottom\u201d for Americans.Drea also warned that a blow to the unions would be a blow to middle-class America. \u201cWe believe the unions built the middle class and we're going to do everything we can to make sure the middle class survives,\u201d he said.The Supreme Court may decide before summer whether to take on the California case.As for the Illinois case, a federal judge in Chicago will decide on it first, though the plaintiffs hope it eventually makes it to the high court as well.45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

They have settled the issue,\" the unidentified spokesman said.\nBoth pilots have been removed from duty following the incident, Sky News reported.\"Both the pilots have been derostered.

    "When tax time rolls around, many homeowners are surprised at the amount of property tax they owe. If you disagree\u00a0with the stated value of your property, it\u2019s worth a closer look to see if your bill has increased fairly.To be sure you\u2019re not paying more than you should, check the following factors.Basic errorsFirst, verify that\u00a0there are no mistakes on your property card \u2014 a document that records information such as dimensions, acreage and value. Does the card show that your home has three bedrooms when it\u00a0only has two? That it sits\u00a0on 3.0-acre lot when it\u2019s only on .30? That it has\u00a0a finished basement when, in fact,\u00a0it doesn\u2019t? That\u00a0it has\u00a0two fireplaces when it\u00a0only has one?Errors like these can \u2014\u00a0and do \u2014\u00a0occur, and they\u2019re actually quite common. But you\u00a0won\u2019t\u00a0know about discrepancies if you haven\u2019t seen your home\u2019s card and reviewed it carefully. Get a copy at the town hall, bringing any errors to the immediate attention of the assessor. Adjustments can often be made without the need for a formal appeal.CompsAfter you pull your home\u2019s property card, take a look at a few\u00a0of your neighbors\u2019 cards \u2014 specifically, neighbors who have homes that are similar to yours in terms of age, size, style, condition and location.How do their assessments line up with yours? Maybe your four-bedroom house with a one-car garage has\u00a0been assessed at $250,000. Your neighbor also owns a four-bedroom home, but this house has a two-car garage, a nice little shed, and even a swimming pool \u2014\u00a0and yet it\u2019s valued at $235,000. Make a case, as you likely have one.Unique conditionsDo you live in a home that\u2019s in deteriorating condition? In a neighborhood that\u2019s undesirable due to strange smells, poor air quality or heavy street traffic? These are the types of factors that could lower your property\u2019s value.ImprovementsPrior to construction, you may have had discussions about how much that new pool or deck was going to cost you in terms of property tax. After all, you needed to know what to expect, and just how much higher the bills were going to be.But here\u2019s the thing: Maybe those structural improvements never came to fruition or are not yet completed, and yet your bill reflects these assessments as if you\u2019ve been enjoying them. Speak up and save!ExemptionsAre you taking advantage of special exemptions? Some states offer tax reductions for veterans, the disabled, and senior citizens. Some also provide reductions for historic buildings and special energy-efficient systems. Ask about these \u2014\u00a0and other incentives for tax reductions \u2014\u00a0that you may be eligible for.

    "Sign in to comment!Long-term US outlook for dealing with IranThis is a rush transcript from \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" April 5, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MARIA BARTIROMO, HOST: Taking the long view on Iran. Good morning, everyone. Happy Easter. I'm Maria Bartiromo. This is \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" The long and twisted road toward a nuclear agreement that could determine our Middle Eastern policy for generations to come. Can the sticking points be surmounted? Congressman Peter King and former ambassador Robert Jordan will weigh in.Plus, Hillary in the hot seat? The select Benghazi committee wants to question her about her private e-mail account. How will she respond now? And then, how will voters respond?Plus, the boys of summer ready to play the first game of the season is today. Major League Baseball's commissioner is with me with news of some exciting innovations for 2015, as we look ahead on this Easter Sunday \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"The six world powers, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and of course the United States, working this past week to hammer out a final deal on Iran's nuclear program by June 30th. But watchers say, after 12 years of talks, even that deadline could get pushed forward. For most, the question comes down to this: Will the ultimate agreement include the enrichment of uranium?Congressman Peter King is a member of the Committee on Homeland Security, and he joins us now.Good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.REP. PETER KING, R-N.Y.: Maria, great to be here.BARTIROMO: You chair the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, so we want to get your insights here. Is that the last sticking point?If that's the case, isn't it black and white? Will they continue to enrich uranium or not?KING: Yeah, that may be the final point they're discussing, but I think this is a bad deal. If everything that we've heard about it is true, basically what we're doing is what the U.S. is agreeing to is to lock in the nuclear infrastructure in Iran, so that they can break loose; they can break out. We're allowing them to keep the uranium, the centrifuges. They're going to have the -- as I understand it, they're going to have the encased locations, which will make it very difficult for us to take them out in the future.So this, to me, is -- you know, we went into this to take away Iran's nuclear power. We are now basically institutionalizing it. We're -- we're, you know, putting it into place. So we're allowing Iran to keep what we said we were going to take away.BARTIROMO: Which is why I come back to isn't this, like, black and white?I mean, at the end of the day, if they continue to enrich uranium, we know that that could possibly or probably lead to a nuclear bomb. Shouldn't that be out of the deal? Is that a deal-breaker?KING: It should be a deal-breaker. I mean, a lot of other things should be a deal-breaker. That should -- that should certainly be a deal breaker. And yet -- I just think this administration and I think the president obviously wants a deal, and he's willing to take a not-so-good deal, because I believe that he wants to, in fact, institutionalize Iran, to make Iran a dominant player in the Middle East so you have the U.S. and Iran almost a balance of power and, I think, almost like maybe in the days of the U.S. and the Soviet Union.Because more and more people I've spoken to both in the administration and in Washington believe the president wants to end the days of us feuding with Iran, and he believes, if Iran is given its leeway, that they will join the community of nations.BARTIROMO: It really is quite extraordinary. In fact, even this past week, you know, most of the players left after it was clear that the deadline had been missed and that, of course, we -- you know, we came to a preliminary framework, but John Kerry stayed. They want a deal to happen.So that's what you worry, that, in fact, the need to want this deal so much and the need for a deal will actually, you know, override some of the things that actually need to be in that deal?KING: Yeah, and we're the one holding the cards. I'm not trying to be overly macho here, but we're the ones who hold the cards, and yet we're the ones who are basically giving the Iranians what they want. You're right; the other countries have left; Kerry is staying behind, almost desperate to get a deal, no matter what. And again, everything the president said in the beginning, for instance, that Iran can never have a nuclear weapon -- well, the fact is we're allowing them to lock in place what it takes to get the nuclear weapon.And as far as breaking out, they will, I believe, have enough time to break out before we know about it.BARTIROMO: Isn't it extraordinary that, also, we are negotiating with Iran right now, but at the same time fighting them on the Saudi side, because Saudi has -- the Saudis have led this strike in Yemen and Iran has said, if the Saudi-led strike continues in Yemen, there will be more bloodshed.KING: But we're also fighting alongside the Iranians in Iraq.BARTIROMO: Exactly.KING: At least our people are fighting alongside them. Yeah, this is -- to me, the Middle East is out of control. The president's doing a lot of juggling here, but I don't think there's any grand strategy. I think he wants to disengage the U.S. and he's willing to live with a strong Iran, believing that, if we make certain concessions to them, that we can work with them.BARTIROMO: How important will all of this be to voters for the 2016 election?I mean, you know, I want to get your take, also, on the Hillary situation as well. But as voters, you know, think about their next president this year and going into next year, do you think foreign policy and the strategy that we have had, or lack of, is going to be an important factor for them?KING: It should be, if we have a Republican that can raise the issue.BARTIROMO: Right.KING: I mean, if we're talking about people that want to disengage, who say the U.S. should be getting out, no, we will not be able to raise the issue. We have to show that we have our own position, that we disagree with the president and we are willing to take the strong actions necessary. And we cannot -- we cannot retreat from the world; we cannot be isolationist.BARTIROMO: Well, look at what's happened. I mean, we have been leading from behind, and today the Middle East is actually a more dangerous place than ever before. Is that a fair statement?KING: It's not even close -- absolutely. It's totally fair. And the situation today is not even close to the past. Libya right now -- we have ISIS is going to Libya; Libya is chaotic. We see what's happening in Iraq where ISIS has made tremendous inroads. The defeats against ISIS have been with the help of Iran, so we're now making Iran more powerful in that region. Yemen is pretty much gone, You have half the country going to Houthis, the other half going to Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula.We can go through country by country, and that's why countries like Israel, Saudi Arabia, are so nervous and desperate over what's happening.BARTIROMO: In fact, when you consider the fact that we pulled our troops out of Iraq, left so much high-tech equipment there, what happened? ISIS took that equipment and now ISIS is fighting the Americans with our equipment.KING: And that's one of the worst decisions any president ever made. By us pulling out of Iraq, that's what created the chaos. Because there was no, in effect, adult supervision of the Iraqis and the Iraqi army, the splintered off between Shiites and Sunnis. So when ISIS came in, the army was no equipped to take them on. Plus, as you said, all that material was left behind.BARTIROMO: All right. Real quick on Hillary: What's your take here? The committee, the select committee on Benghazi wants to see the e-mails. She wiped the server clean.I don't know. On any other planet, if you wipe the server clean and you destroy government evidence, I would say you would disqualify yourself as being the leader of the free world. What do you think?KING: I've (inaudible) to Trey Gowdy. He's going to follow this all the way. It's a long way from now to the election, but if anything at all - - if there's any smoking gun turns up, then Hillary Clinton is going to have a real issue.And you're right: the whole question of why, but she may be able to stall that one out. I think you're going to need more of a smoking gun, someone who was there who can claim that this was done for the wrong motive. Other than that, it's her word against everybody else's, and it's a long way to Election Day.BARTIROMO: I don't think her core has really been impacted. Do you think the voters will get impacted by what she's done?KING: They may in the general election if we have a candidate who can raise it as an issue.BARTIROMO: Congressman, good to have you on the show.KING: Maria, thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Always nice to see you.KING: Appreciate it.BARTIROMO: Our long-term deadlines with Iran, even as our allies are battling Iranian-backed rebels in places like Yemen and Syria underscores just how complicated the Middle East can get. Ambassador Robert Jordan will join us, next, to shed some light.Follow me on Twitter @mariabartiromo @sundayfutures. Let us know what you'd like to hear from Ambassador Jordan, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Saudi Arabia taking matters into its own hands in Yemen, leading an air war against Iranian-backed Shiite rebels there.But a different situation played out in Tikrit last week, where Iraqis were backed by Iranians against ISIS. The Iranians could not get the job done and U.S. air strikes finished the job.All of this, of course, as the Obama White House aims for a long-term transformative deal with Tehran.Robert Jordan was U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia during George W. Bush's administration.He is now Southern Methodist University's diplomat in residence.And Ambassador, it is wonderful to have you on the program.AMB. ROBERT JORDAN, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO SAUDI ARABIA: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us.Can you take us through the background of what's happening in terms of this Saudi-led air strike in Yemen right now?JORDAN: Well, this goes back a long way. The Saudis have basically lost confidence in this administration for a number of reasons, starting with the failure to enforce a red line declaration that President Obama made about Syria's use of chemical weapons, a failure to rein in the Israeli settlements, and a number of other factors.So the Saudis, I think, have finally decided they have to take charge of their own neighborhood and that has led to building the coalition, developing the air strikes that we've seen in Yemen, which probably won't be enough by themselves, but are certainly an important -- an important way of degrading the Houthis.BARTIROMO: But the story gets more complicated as we know that Iran wants the air strikes to stop and has said if the Saudi-led effort continues, there will be more bloodshed.Meanwhile, we are working alongside Iran when it comes to Iraq against ISIS.JORDAN: Well, we're working in parallel with Iran, but I'm not sure that it's exactly alongside. The air strikes were necessary but they were at the invitation of the Iraqi government and that's an important distinction. And it's more than just a fig leaf.So I think it's important that we recognize that we're not literally partnering up with Iran. We have a common enemy right now, but that doesn't make us friends.BARTIROMO: We have had so many failures in the Middle East, really, these last few years, whether you're talking about what you just referred to, that red line which was crossed and then never done anything about in Syria, or Yemen or any other of the hot spots.Can you characterize the US' foreign policy today and what you think should be done?JORDAN: Well, this president has said many times that he wants to be on the right side of history. Frankly, I think he's being run over by history. He's taking a -- failing to take into account the necessity of maintaining security for the local populations that are in the midst of these upheavals.So I think that's number one.Number two, I think that we have to bear in mind that there is a long- term strategic interest in having a balance of power in the Middle East. \u00a0This doesn't mean that we have to turn our backs on our friends, the Saudis, the Emiratis and the other Sunni monarchies and even Egypt.So I think they're finally realizing that they have to have security. \u00a0They have to have order. And they have to have a strong enough government to make the kind of reforms incrementally that apparently this administration initially had hoped could come overnight.BARTIROMO: We recognize that the final deadline for a deal with Iran, obviously, is not until June. But what would be different in June to what we have been talking about today and last week and as we got that initially framework at the end of last week?JORDAN: Well, I think the framework discussions are basically an exercise in kicking the can down the road. They are not specific. They are notional. They are directional, which is about all you could frankly expect at this time.By June, they all expect to have a written agreement, something that is enforceable, something that has much more teeth to it. So the -- the March deadline was effectively a -- an effort to set something down but it was never intended to be a real deadline in terms of having a concrete agreement.I think the real agreement is going to be coming in June.BARTIROMO: Yes.What do you think that agreement looks like?I was talking with Peter King a moment ago. And I -- and I wondered if, in fact, this is very straightforward and very black and white.Is this just about stopping the enrichment of uranium or do you believe the U.S. will accept a deal that has the Iranians continuing to enrich uranium?JORDAN: Well, there may be a limit on centrifuges, which would, of course, be important.Secondly, the real key, I think, is enforcement and inspection, verification. If we don't have something that can be verified, that we don't have intrusive inspections, and if we don't have an enforcement mechanism to immediately deal with violations, then we've been wasting our time.BARTIROMO: Well, why would we expect we would have, you know, checkups that actually materialize, when we actually haven't had the kinds of checks by the U.N. inspectors that we wanted?JORDAN: Well, I think we're going to have to insist on it. If this government doesn't insist on verification and inspections and enforcement, then they're wasting their own time and they're wasting a lot of people's time.BARTIROMO: Well, what does -- what is the president's motivation in terms of the way he approaches foreign policy?Do you -- do you know?JORDAN: Well, it's hard to guess. My suspicion right now is that he wants to leave some kind of legacy with respect to a nuclear agreement. I don't think he expects to bring Iran into the family of nations. I don't think he expects Iran to cease their terrorist activities and support for Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations.But I do think if he can at least claim to have some sort of a nuclear agreement in which they have ceased to weaponize their enrichment, then I think he will claim that he's got some sort of legacy that he can leave behind. There isn't much other meat on that bone.BARTIROMO: Yes. Let me ask you this, what if a deal does not happen, Ambassador?What -- what do you think the implications of no deal happens once these talks end in June?JORDAN: Well, it's going to animate the Israelis and the Saudis, for one. I think the Saudis especially could be included to develop their own nuclear program, perhaps in concert with Pakistan. So that's something that I would be very worried about.Second, I think it's going to be increasingly difficult to detect what Iran is doing and it's going to be hard to keep the Israelis from trying to take some sort of military action.BARTIROMO: So it -- it sounds like a race to the bottom in terms of Middle Eastern countries getting their hands on -- on nukes?JORDAN: There are no good solutions here, but hopefully, we can see some progress and some verification. If we don't, then it is a race to the bottom.BARTIROMO: Ambassador, good to have you on the show today.Thanks so much.JORDAN: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: Ambassador Robert Jordan joining us.Innovative technology at the ball park and streamlining the pace of play -- just two initiatives the commissioner of baseball says are underway with the new season.He's on deck as we are now looking at opening day tonight and looking ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"Back in a moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: It is opening day, or rather opening night, with the Cubs and the Cardinals taking to the diamond at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time tonight. Major League Baseball has enjoyed record revenues exceeding $9 billion last year. The business is doing well.So will 2015 be the year it breaks 11 digits?Robert Manfred is with me. He's the tenth and current commissioner of Major League Baseball. And it is great to have you on the show, Commissioner.ROBERT MANFRED, MLB COMMISSIONER: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us.So it's nice to see such success of MLB. You have already made some changes to the game. You're trying to pick up the pace, get the fans in their seats at the stadium. How's it going and what is on your agenda right now?MANFRED: Well, we're really encouraged by the early returns on our pace-a-game effort. It's part of a broader effort. We're working hard on getting younger people attracted to the game. We're working hard on youth participation. And we're also encouraging the demographic where we're strong, parents and grandparents, to make sure they bring their kids to the ballpark.BARTIROMO: Yeah, and absolutely, people want, sort of, a mentor. So with Derek Jeter retired, who would you say is the face of baseball today?MANFRED: You know, we have got a great young group of players coming along. It's hard to answer that question, but I'd give you four names, Mike Trout, Clayton Kershaw, Andrew McCutchen and Jose Fernandez.BARTIROMO: All right. Well, these are some of the stars, and so, you know, that -- you never know who's going to stick with the fans.MANFRED: That's right. And part of it depends on how their teams do. You know, Derek was obviously personally appealing, but he also had the advantage of being part of great Yankee teams.BARTIROMO: What about the A-Rod ban? I mean, Alex Rodriguez now back from his season-long ban, but is there a distraction to baseball as a result of what went on?MANFRED: I don't really see it as a distraction. As a matter of fact, I think it generates interest in the game. People are generally forgiving. Alex served a very severe penalty. And I think people are interested in seeing how he's going to do this year.BARTIROMO: So what you do now in terms of making sure steroids are not in the game, keeping it out of the game, making sure that you've got drug testing going on?Are there -- are there plans in place that you're going to ensure?MANFRED: Yeah, the key on the issue of performance-enhancing drugs is constant vigilance. We have developed great relationships with organizations like WADA and USADA, the world anti-doping agencies, in order to make sure that we're on top of the developments in that area. And each and every year, even if we don't have a collective bargaining agreement, we sit down with the Players Association and update our program.BARTIROMO: Let's talk about expansion and growth. You're expanding in Asia, Latin America. Why are those markets so important?MANFRED: Well, Asia and Latin America are right for us because there are great baseball traditions in those areas. You know, Korea, Japan, Taiwan all have great baseball traditions. And they're good targets for us. But we also are interested in newer markets where baseball is not as popular. And I think, in the coming years, you'll see us make efforts in places like Europe.BARTIROMO: What about Cuba? I mean, obviously, we have seen a number of talented players coming out of Cuba. President Obama announced his plan to restore diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuba. It's produced a number of talented players who either played or are currently in the league. Do you envision Cuba being a big part of baseball?MANFRED: I do. I think the flow of talent out of Cuba is going to continue to be strong. I think you're going to see more and more players from Cuba in the major leagues. In addition, we hope that the environment continues to evolve in a way that allows us to do some real business in Cuba.BARTIROMO: I want to talk about the technology end of it. I know you're doing a lot in terms of getting fans in the seats, trying to engage in social media. But it was also recently announced that the NFL will live- stream a game this fall, first time in history. Are there plans for baseball to try that out as well, live-streaming?MANFRED: Well, remember, we had the first live-streaming product ever. MLB.tv debuted -- I think it was seven or eight years ago, and all of our games in the -- you know, except in the home television territory, are available over the top on MLB.tv.BARTIROMO: All right. So you were the first. And, obviously, this is, sort of, the new normal in business in general?MANFRED: Right. It's part of a really rapidly evolving television environment. Obviously, for our teams, the current cable model has been great for us. Our media revenue has really exploded. And we think we that can use streaming in a way that supports the current cable model.BARTIROMO: And I know you've had incredible success with MLB advanced media, which is working on this as well. In terms of fans watching it at home, coming to the stadium, how do you get -- is it that critical to get your fans in the stadium, in terms of business? Because you can watch -- you could have a great experience at home these days.MANFRED: Our game is still a gate-driven game. It's really important to our economics that we have good attendance. You know, over our 2,430 dates, we average about 30,000 people a night. And it's crucial to our business. And we do think we continue to have a really positive, affordable, family in-park experience.BARTIROMO: Tell me about the growth, in terms of taking it to the next level, in terms of business? What are your most important issues that you're going to be dealing with?MANFRED: I think that the most important issue for us is to make sure that we're prepared to deal with the changing media environment. As you alluded to earlier, there's a lot going on in that space. Media is a crucial part of our business and we feel that, with MLB Advanced Media, we're well-positioned to deal with those changes.BARTIROMO: I read that you said your wife gave you the best advice when it came to being appointed commissioner. What was her advice?MANFRED: Her advice was be your own man. And I'm trying hard.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: I like it. And you're going to be throwing out the first pitch tonight? You ready for it?MANFRED: Actually, I'm going to do the first pitch in Washington on Monday.BARTIROMO: Oh, on Monday, OK.MANFRED: On Monday, right.BARTIROMO: Have you been practicing for that?MANFRED: Oh, I have been practicing. If you don't practice for a first pitch, you're making a mistake.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Exactly, exactly.It's great to have you on the program, Commissioner. Thank you so much.MANFRED: It's great to be here with you.BARTIROMO: Commissioner Robert Manfred, joining us, MLB.Hillary Clinton asked to appear before the Benghazi select committee on May 1st. Our panel will begin right there, next, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"(COMMERCIAL BREAK)ERIC SHAWN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Live from \"America's News Headquarters,\" I'm Eric Shawn. Christians around the world are celebrating Easter, Pope Francis leading a solemn mass at the Vatican before tens of thousands of the faithful braving a downpour to pack St. Peter's Square, the Holy Father praising the nuclear framework deal with Iran, as he said, \"a chance for peace,\" while condemning deadly violence in the Middle East and Africa and remembering those students killed in Kenya this week, targeted because they were Christians.A shocker at the Final Four, Wisconsin ending Kentucky's perfect season in the semifinals, the Badgers beating the Wildcats 71-64 to advance to the final against Duke, who beat Michigan State. There was chaos, then, after the game, about 1,500 Kentucky fans rioting near the campus in Lexington, setting fires in the streets, police arresting 31 people.I'm Eric Shawn. I'll see you back at 12 noon Eastern with Arthel Neville and more news. Now back to \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Trey Gowdy, the chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi sending a letter to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, asking her to take part in a, quote, \"transcribed interview\" regarding her use of private e-mail on a personal server for official State Department business.We want to bring in our panel on this. Ed Rollins is former principal White House advisor to President Reagan. He has been a longtime strategist to business and political leaders. He is a Fox News political analyst. Judith Miller is adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research. She's a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and journalist and a Fox News contributor. And Doug Heye was the deputy chief of staff for communication to former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.Good to see you all. Thanks so much for joining us.Do you think this is going to stick? What -- what plays out in this select Benghazi committee?ED ROLLINS, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Well, she does not want to go private. She wants to do it in a public hearing, and my sense, that she wants to do that, that's what she'll end up getting, and I think, to a certain extent, it benefits Republicans because they won't be -- it won't be behind the scenes. They have to be very careful how they approach this. They need to get as much information as they can. Gowdy is a former prosecutor and I think it will be a very interesting day.BARTIROMO: Why do you think she wants a -- a public hearing?ROLLINS: Because then she controls the environment. She basically knows what she says and what she's going to say. And I think, to a certain extent, she's pitting herself against the republicans and I think it's -- from her perspective, she thinks it's a good move.BARTIROMO: But what could she say, Judy? I mean, she wiped to the server clean, so what is there to say?JUDITH MILLER, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE FOR POLICY RESEARCH: Well, she can undo the damage she did with the U.N. press conference, where she first explained what she had done and then kept adding on all the other number of devices she had -- look, this is not a legal issue; this is now a political issue. Because it's very clear that Hillary is a lawyer. She -- I'm sure she went right up to the line, and since this is now in the political arena, she's going to try and score political points and do that at a hearing.BARTIROMO: How do you see it, Doug?DOUG HEYE, GOP COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGIST: Yeah. I think this is the least bad option for Hillary Clinton. We have to remember she doesn't do these particular events very well. And one of the things she needs to be careful of is she controls her message as tightly as she can. She can't afford to have a \"what difference does it make\" moment or anything like that.I worked in the Capitol when Trey Gowdy was selected. He was selected for a reason, not just that he's a former prosecutor, but he's somebody who understands the difference between about being aggressive and also showing the necessary restraint you need to not to overplay your hand.BARTIROMO: But how do you explain wiping the server clean?MILLER: I mean, you know, it's -- it's her obsession with controlling message, controlling information, lack of transparency. It's everything we've seen for so long. Here on the Planet Hillary, it seems to play.HEYE: These are not -- remember, these are not un-shrewd, smart politicians. We have known for 20 years that the Clintons are very calculating in what they do, very effective with what they do. So there's no accidents.ROLLINS: No other government official has, in a Cabinet post, would basically have the same option that \"I'm not going to do -- I'm not going to use the government machines; I'm going to basically do it privately in my house up in Chappaquiddick and I'll give you what I want to give you.\" And I think it's outrageous. And I think, to a certain extent, it's -- it's going to be a long-term battle for her.BARTIROMO: And it's hard to explain other than \"I don't want to be followed; I don't want to be spied on.\"MILLER: \"I don't want to be accountable.\"BARTIROMO: \"I don't want to be accountable.\"ROLLINS: And that's exactly what it is.HEYE: And, politically, this is coming at a bad time for Clinton. You know, we've seen for a while Democrats have said, \"Well, this doesn't matter in the polls.\" It's actually starting to matter in polls, and it's mattering -- actually, she's hiring staff here in New York and also ramping up to do an announcement. This is not good timing for Hillary Clinton. \u00a0ROLLINS: It's not the way you want to launch a presidential campaign. It reminds people of all of the drama that has gone on during -- for the eight years of the Clinton administration.BARTIROMO: Yeah. I wonder, though, if it's actually impacting. I mean, you say it is impacting voters?HEYE: We're starting to see polling show...BARTIROMO: You're starting to see polling?HEYE: And it goes to exactly what I had said. This reminds voters of why they're uneasy with Hillary Clinton to begin with.ROLLINS: It's an integrity issue.MILLER: Right.BARTIROMO: It is an integrity issue.MILLER: Different rules for the Clintons than for the rest of us hoi polloi.BARTIROMO: Yeah, so when do you think she announces her -- her candidacy?I mean, it's hard to do it in the middle of all of this, hard to do it while she's testifying.ROLLINS: She has to do it because she doesn't have any staff. She has to start raising the money and she has to basically get a staff. I think one of the weaknesses she has is she doesn't have professionals on her staff that can go out and deal with this. There's no press secretary out there every day fighting back, and she needs to get that campaign up and functioning.HEYE: I can tell you from Democrats I was talking to, when she was having this press conference and initially dealing with this, they weren't getting the talking points they needed to go on shows like this and defend her. She's got to ramp this up really quickly. She's starting to hire some really good staff, but that framework is not in place yet.BARTIROMO: And what if it doesn't work?Is there a bench on the Democratic side, in terms of who their candidate might be?HEYE: It's a very thin one, but they're -- they're eyeing this very nervously. You've got Martin O'Malley, who's at 1 percent in the polls with Democrats. But he's somebody who's really waiting at the wings.You have Kerry and Biden, who will go at it if, for some reason, she doesn't run, either health purposes or she gets disqualified here. And Kerry and Biden is not going to be a very pretty race, at the end of the day. They're two losers who have lost in presidential races before, Kerry obviously running for the president, Biden twice running for the nomination. So my sense is it's a very thin bench.MILLER: But Governor O'Malley also has a line now, which is, you know, \"We're not into dynastic elections here.\"BARTIROMO: He's getting ready?MILLER: He's getting ready. That's, I think, a theme that's going to resonate with voters.",
    "Sign in to comment!President Obama appealed to lawmakers to reconsider contentious legislation giving Congress a say on an Iran nuclear deal, as the co-author of the bill vowed to hold a key vote next week.In an interview published Sunday, Obama said the newly agreed framework of a nuclear deal with Iran represented a \"once in a lifetime opportunity\" to prevent Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and move toward stabilizing the Middle East.\"I've been very clear that Iran will not get a nuclear weapon on my watch, and I think they should understand that we mean it,\" Obama told New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman. \"But I say that hoping that we can conclude this diplomatic arrangement -- and that it ushers a new era in U.S.-Iranian relations - and, just as importantly, over time, a new era in Iranian relations with its neighbors.\"Obama cautioned there are many details that still need to be worked out with the Iranians and there would be \"real political difficulties\" in implementing an agreement in both countries.He reiterated his opposition to legislation that would give Congress final say in approving or rejecting a deal, but said he hoped to find a path to allow Congress to \"express itself.\"But the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in an interview with \"Fox News Sunday,\" said Congress would exercise its \"rightful role\" to scrutinize and approve any agreement to curb Iran's nuclear program in exchange for lifting international sanctions.\"It's very important that Congress is in the middle of this, understanding, teasing out, asking those important questions,\" Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said Sunday.Corker's office said Sunday the Foreign Relations Committee would vote on April 14 on the review legislation. Amid sustained opposition from the White House, Corker said that the Senate is two or three votes shy of the 67 needed to override a vowed White House veto.The so-called P5+1 nations -- the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China -- have until June 30 to agree on all the details of a final deal with Iran.\"The American people want to know somebody is teasing out the information\" about the deal, Corker said Sunday. \"Congress has to be involved in this way.\"Apart from Congress, Obama must also handle Arab allies who are skeptical about a possible agreement. The president has invited leaders of six Gulf nations to Washington this spring and said he wanted to \"formalize\" U.S. assistance.The nuclear talks have marked a remarkable shift in the frozen relationship between the U.S. and Iran. It has become normal for officials from both countries to communicate and hold face-to-face meetings. Obama is yet to meet with Iranian President Hasan Rouhani, though they did speak on the phone. He has also exchanged letters with Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Obama said the letters include \"a lot of reminders of what he perceives as past grievances against Iran.\" But he said the concessions Khamenei allowed his negotiators to make in the nuclear talks suggests that \"he does realize that the sanctions regime that we put together was weakening Iran over the long term, and that if in fact he wanted to see Iran re-enter the community of nations, then there were going to have to be changes.\"The Associated Press contributed to this report.51%47%13%75%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

    "Sign in to comment!FILE - In this Feb. 23, 2014 file photo, an Army SPC hoists a 44-pound section of a 50 caliber machine gun onto a M1 A2 Abrams tank during a physical demands study at Ft. Stewart, Ga. (AP Photo/Stephen B. Morton, File)WASHINGTON \u2013 \u00a0Surveys find that men in U.S. special operations forces do not believe women can meet the physical and mental demands of their commando jobs, and they fear the Pentagon will lower standards to integrate women into their elite units, according to interviews and documents obtained by The Associated Press.Studies that surveyed personnel found \"major misconceptions\" within special operations about whether women should be brought into the male-only jobs. They also revealed concerns that department leaders would \"capitulate to political pressure, allowing erosion of training standards,\" according to one document.Some of those concerns were not limited to men, researchers found, but also were found among women in special operations jobs.Dan Bland, force management director for U.S. Special Operations Command, told the AP that the survey results have \"already driven us to do some different things in terms of educating the force.\"About 68,800 people serve in the command, including 3,000 civilians. The main survey went to about 18,000 people who are in positions closed to women, and the response was about 50 percent. The high response rate, officials said, reflects the wide interest in the subject.The studies are part of the Pentagon's effort to open all military combat positions to women or provide reasons why any jobs should remain closed.One survey, by RAND Corp., reflected doubts that women could meet the overall job demands, found concerns that sexual harassment or assault could increase, and cited worries about \"unequal treatment\" of special operations candidates and personnel. Some worried that if women were let in to some jobs, they might be treated more harshly.Survey details have not been released. This was the first time that officials from Special Operations Command publicly discussed the results.Andy Hamilton, who works with Bland and has expertise on this issue, noted that women in special operations jobs had concerns, too, about the broader integration.\"They're concerned that this might result in the lowering of the standards in what are currently our male-only occupations, and that would then reflect on either them or on the women who come into those occupations,\" said Hamilton.Pentagon leaders lifted the ban on women in combat jobs in 2012, but gave the military services time to integrate women gradually and systematically into the male-only front-line positions. By January 2016, the military must open all combat jobs to women or explain why any exceptions must be made.Positions within the special operations forces, including the clandestine Navy SEAL and Army Delta units, are considered the most grueling and difficult jobs in the military, with training and qualifying courses that push troops to their physical, mental and emotional limits. The commandos often work in small teams in harsh, remote locations.As a result, those jobs are some of the last to be addressed as commanders review the qualifications needed and assess the impact of bringing in women.As integration unfolds, the surveys have brought home the reality that there are \"some reservations or misperceptions in the force in terms of why we're doing this,\" Bland said. Defense officials have stressed that they will not reduce standards in order to let in women.Women have so far had mixed results as they try to move into the more demanding combat positions \u2014 jobs for which men also have difficulty qualifying.So far, about 7,200 positions within the special operations forces have been opened to women, including combat jobs in the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, a specialized unit used to fly forces fast, low and deep behind enemy lines at night. For the first time, a woman last year made it through training and began serving as a pilot in the unit. Three female pilots, 25 women in other jobs, and 16 other women are now going through initial training for these helicopter crews, known as Night Stalkers.Most female soldiers do not want combat jobs, an earlier survey found. But among those who do, the Night Stalkers were a popular choice.Women have moved into Army artillery jobs and serve on Navy submarines and in the naval Riverine units. But none has made it through the Marine Corps' officer infantry course.Special operations command leaders have made it clear that genuine concerns exist about incorporating women into some jobs.In 2013, when the planning was in its infancy, then-Maj. Gen. Bennet Sacolick spoke of the demanding nature of missions requiring forces \"to operate in small, self-contained teams, many of which are in austere, geographically isolated, politically sensitive environments for extended periods of time.\"In an email last month to members of the special operations forces across the services, Gen. Joseph Votel, head of U.S. Special Operations Command, said leaders had done initial analysis on training, facilities, education and other policies. Now, officials are examining \"the social and cultural challenges of integrating females\" into male-only jobs.Next, Votel said, officials will analyze requirements for the jobs to make sure standards are accurate and gender neutral.\"We will continue in our commitment to provide the best manned, trained, and equipped special operations personnel to execute our nation's most difficult and sensitive missions,\" Votel said. \"With that in mind, we can assure you that our high standards will not be lowered.\"Bland said that in addition to Votel's email to service members, leaders have discussed the issue with commanders at frequent meetings so they can better educate their troops.45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

You will have to estimate when you can expect to pay the bill, and do a cost-benefit analysis on whether the interest you will pay on the credit card or loan is greater than the potential penalties that you would pay the IRS for a delayed or partial payment.Do not forget to include the fees associated with paying taxes by credit card with an approved vendor (generally 1.88% of the transaction).Apply for A Short Extension \u2013 You can fill out the Online Payment Agreement application on the IRS website to stretch out your debt repayment over 60-120 days, or you can call the IRS directly to make the same request. By contacting the IRS, setting up the extension, and paying what you can before the deadline, you will minimize the penalties and interest that you owe.Before making the final payment, contact the IRS to verify the correct amount of accrued interest, especially if you are paying before the end of the extension. Do not wait on a bill from the IRS.Request Installment Payment \u2013 If you need more than 120 days to pay your bill, consider using IRS Form 9465-FS, \u201cInstallment Agreement Request\u201d to set up a payment plan. There will be a fee to set up the plan and after that point you will pay the bill in monthly increments that you set up \u2014 assuming the IRS approves your plan. Your payment plan must not stretch out the payments for more than three years.File Form 9465 as early as possible because it may take up to thirty days for the IRS to let you know if it has been approved.Ask For a Hardship Extension \u2013 If you qualify for an extension due to financial hardship, you can file Form 1127-A with the IRS before the filing deadline to claim an extension of up to six months. Hardship cases require showing a substantial financial loss if the tax is paid on time (for example, having to sell property at a sacrificial loss). A prolonged period of unemployment may qualify.The IRS does not consider a mere inconvenience worthy of a hardship, and you will have to explain why borrowing the money is not a viable option for you. You must supply a statement of assets and liabilities at the end of the previous month prior to filing the form, and list all income and expenses for the prior three months. If you have enough advance warning, we suggest contacting the IRS first to see if you are likely to qualify for a hardship situation.In general, your best bet to limit the damage is to contact the IRS before the filing date and pay whatever you can at the regular filing deadline to minimize the damage. Investigate the options above to see which one best fits your situation, and do not ignore the problem. Do not expect the IRS to just go away and leave you alone. It won\u2019t happen.More from MoneyTips.comThe Punishing Costs of Paying Your Taxes Late\nFinancial Benefits of Investing Your Tax Refund\nTax Day Last Minute Filing+ FollowFox Business on FacebookMore\u203aInvesting\u203a",

Other sculptors have quoted a price tag of about $5,000.\"We'd like to work with the original sculptor, and wish he would stand behind his work enough to step up and fix it for free,\" Celoron Mayor Scott Schrecengost told the newspaper.He said no taxpayer funds will be used for the statue project. The village has started a fundraising effort to pay for the sculpture's makeover.A statue replacement campaign has been launched on Facebook with the name, \"We Love Lucy! Get Rid of this Statue.\"The statue was commissioned privately by a couple who hired a sculptor from neighboring Jamestown, 60 miles south of Buffalo. The 400-pound statue was installed in August 2009 in a park Celoron, where Ball spent much of her youth.The statue depicts Ball with her signature swept-up hairdo, but the sculpture's face has been described by some online critics as \"a nightmare\" that resembles a drunken zombie. The sculpture shows Ball holding a spoon and a bottle of Vitameatavegamin, a fictional elixir featured in one of her most famous episodes.Advertisement",

    "Sign in to comment!Obama calls Iran nuke deal 'once in a lifetime opportunity'The Obama administration mounted a new argument Monday for why skeptical lawmakers and U.S. allies should back the preliminary nuclear agreement with Iran, calling it a \u201cforever agreement\u201d that would block all pathways to a nuclear weapon and set up tough international inspections with no end date.Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, in a rare appearance at the White House press briefing, used that term in defending the deal he helped strike in Switzerland.\u201cI want to say this is not an agreement for 10 years or 15 years or 20 years. It is a long-term agreement with a whole set of phases,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if Iran earns over this time period trust and confidence in their peaceful objectives, well then over time the constraints will, in phases, ease up, but never get lower than the additional protocol and all of the access that it provides.\u201cSo that's the way we\u2019re thinking about it. It's not a fixed-year agreement. It's a forever agreement in a certain sense, with different stages.\u201dYet, as Moniz acknowledged, the fact-sheet circulated by the White House last week includes a series of expiration dates for key components of the deal.This includes:Asked Monday how this could be considered \u201cforever,\u201d White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said they were referring to how Iran would have to submit to a new set of intrusive nuclear inspections, as part of provisions that have \u201cno end date.\u201dMoniz likewise pointed to these comprehensive inspections \u2013 part of what he called \u201cunprecedented\u201d access and transparency -- in calling this a \u201cforever agreement.\u201d (Some of those inspection requirements still have end-dates on them, though much further out than 10 or 15 years.)Moniz, a nuclear physicist, spoke at the White House as the Obama administration ramped up its campaign for a framework deal with Iran that has drawn criticism from congressional Republicans, the Israeli government and skeptical Arab allies of the U.S.Under the agreement, Moniz said, all plutonium created as a byproduct of Iran's nuclear power production would be sent out of the country so it couldn't be used to make weapons. And international inspectors would watch over all stages to ensure Tehran sticks to the agreement. \"This is not built upon trust, this is built upon hard-nosed requirements,\" Moniz said.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been among the most vocal critics in airing concerns about how certain terms of the deal last for just 10 years.For the near term, though, the Obama administration is perhaps most concerned about selling this deal to Congress, where lawmakers are set to soon consider bipartisan legislation giving Congress a say on any Iran deal.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Monday reiterated some of his concerns with the deal, citing the timeline spelled out in the framework unveiled last week.\u201cThe parameters of the interim deal, in essence, establish an internationally recognized, 10-year nuclear research and development program. Until we know more about Iran's previous research, no nation can be sure of what Iran may have developed covertly already,\u201d he said in a statement. McConnell vowed that the Senate would \u201crespond legislatively\u201d with the congressional review bill, which is set for a committee vote next week.House Speaker John Boehner, meanwhile, linked from his Twitter page to a first-hand account of his call last week with Obama on the agreement.\u201cIt would be na\u00efve to suggest the Iranian regime will not continue to use its nuclear program, and any economic relief, to further destabilize the region,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cIn the weeks ahead, Republicans and Democrats in Congress will continue to press this administration on the details of these parameters and the tough questions that remain unanswered. We will stand strong on behalf of the American people and everyone in the Middle East who values freedom, security, and peace.\u201dObama continues to staunchly defend the framework agreement worked out with other world powers as a \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\" to prevent an Iranian bomb and bring longer-term stability to the Middle East. He insists the U.S. would stand by Israel if it were to come under attack, but acknowledged that his pursuit of diplomacy with Tehran has caused strain with the close ally.\"It's been a hard period,\" Obama said in an interview with New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman. He added that it is \"personally difficult\" for him to hear his administration accused of not looking out for Israel's interests.The framework reached with Iran last week clears the way for negotiators to hammer out technical details ahead of a June 30 deadline for a final deal.He reiterated his opposition to the legislation that would give the U.S. Congress final say in approving or rejecting a deal, but said he hoped to find a path to allow Congress to \"express itself.\"Earnest on Monday urged Congress to at least wait until June to pass judgment on the plan, while still opposing\u00a0any up-or-down vote in Congress.The Associated Press contributed to this report.45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

    "It is hard to beat the convenience of a credit card for purchases, but does that same convenience make it worth paying your taxes by credit card? It might, but that depends on several factors involving money and time. The major ones are listed below.Fees \u2013 By law, the IRS cannot pay credit card transaction fees. As a result, credit card payments to the IRS are handled through secure third parties approved by the agency. See http://www.irs.gov/uac/Pay-Taxes-by-Credit-or-Debit-Card for a list of the approved payment processors and their fees.Credit card fees are percentage-based with a minimum \u201cconvenience fee\u201d for smaller bills ranging from $2.59 to $3.50. Percentages range from 1.87%-2.35% of the total tax bill depending on the vendor and the type of card used.You will also find debit card information for each listed vendor. Debit card transactions are charged a simple flat fee ranging from $2.49 to $3.95 for tax year 2014. If you have a large tax bill and the money in your account to cover it, a debit card may make more sense. Consider that at the lowest percentage rate of 1.87% on your tax bill, your tax bill would have to be approximately $211 for the fee to equal the highest possible debit charge of $3.95.Cash Flow Problems \u2013 If you are short on cash to pay your tax bill before the due date, payment by debit card is not an option. Payment by credit card can spare you potentially stiff IRS penalties, fees, and accrued interest.However, if you contact the IRS to set up an installment payment plan, you may find that these charges amount to less than the interest you will pay on carrying a credit card balance. For tax bills less than $25,000 you can generally submit your own payment plan of three years or less for IRS approval.To assess this situation correctly, it is really important to have a handle on your upcoming income and bills to determine how long it is likely to take you to pay off the tax bill.Rewards Programs \u2013 Many cards offer cash back, frequent flyer miles, or similar incentive programs. If you can run your tax bill through your credit card and can afford to pay it off without carrying a balance, simply compare the credit card processing fees with the value of the rewards and go with the more economical approach.If you must carry a balance, this method usually only makes sense if you have a card at a zero or low introductory short-term interest rate. The typical annual percentage rate (APR) on your balance is likely to overwhelm your potential rewards.Collective Debt \u2013 For a relatively small tax bill, paying it by credit card will have virtually no effect on your overall credit rating. However, if you have a bill well into the thousands or your tax bill is pushing the maximum credit limit on your card, your credit score will be affected because your credit utilization ratio will rise.The credit utilization ratio compares your total outstanding debt to your total available credit. Experts suggest keeping this ratio below 30% if possible; 50% or greater may be a red flag to creditors who will offer you higher short-term interest rates as a result.Consider the effect on any other purchases you plan to make before the debt is paid down, especially if you are trying to qualify for a mortgage.\nMany people paying by credit card do so automatically as part of the e-filing process, but you can pay with your credit card by phone if you prefer.In summary, credit cards are usually the best option whenever you can avoid carrying a balance and receive rewards that surpass the fees, or if you do not have the money in hand now but expect the income to be able to pay the bill off relatively soon and avoid excessive interest charges from your credit card issuer. Make your assumptions on future income and short-term bills, and then break out the calculator (or spreadsheet, if you prefer) to find out which path makes the most economic sense for you.More from MoneyTips.comYou Owe Taxes, But Can\u2019t Pay the Bill\nThe Punishing Costs of Paying Your Taxes Late\n7 Out of 10 Taxpayers Plan to Use Their Refund to Pay Down Debt+ FollowFox Business on FacebookMore\u203aInvesting\u203a",

    "In the 1950s, what constituted \u201cwife material\u201d was pretty basic compared to how it is now. \u201cPerfect\u201d wives were women who stayed home to take care of the kids, keep the house in order, and have dinner ready promptly at 6 p.m. when her husband walked through the door. Women\u2019s aspirations became second to fulfilling their \u201cwifely duties.\u201d And it sounds terribly depressing, to be honest.SEE IT: Booze, Bras and Husbands: What Women Wanted According to Vintage AdsBut, being that it\u2019s 2015, so much has changed since then. What makes a woman a wife isn\u2019t about being docile, submissive, and letting the man run the show. Thanks to the Women\u2019s Movement, there is an equality that makes both men want to find their partner and not their, well, maid.We talked to 11 men about what makes a woman \u201cwife material.\u201d This is what they had to tell us.\"It just boils down to love and attraction. I don't mean any kind of romantic ideal, but like, proper love, where you love them so much that even when you're mid-argument and super angry you still make sure they take an umbrella to work because it might rain. Any person who loves you that much in equal measure, and doesn't mind risking a sex-related hip fracture when you're both in your 70s, is definitely marriage material.\"\"Basically, I need someone who will both challenge and complete me. I don't want a fan or sycophant, nor do I want an adversary. The ideal woman will have an understanding of my strengths and weaknesses and exploit them not to injure me, but to make me better. She would also have an insatiable intellectual curiosity and big boobs. But in all seriousness, I don't know that we need to have the perfect woman to qualify as marriage material. I know I don't.

That's the most important thing a woman a can have if I were to want to marry her. Of course I'd want her to be kind, genuine, adventurous and someone with whom I'd like to share my life, but above all is sense of humor. Laughing and loving together is what makes a long-lasting relationship.\u201d\u201cI know this is going to come off sexist, but it isn't. I swear. That being said, wife material for me is a woman who can cook and cook well, like French-pastry-type well. Not because I want her in the kitchen but because I can't cook to save my life, but eating is a passion of mine. If her passion is to cook and mine is to eat, then we can't lose. I'd like to say once again that this isn't me giving in to gender stereotypes. Cooking and eating together is sexy.

Also, I can\u2019t marry someone who isn\u2019t funny.\u201d\u201cLooking at my parents\u2019 marriage, there wasn\u2019t as much emotional support as I think my mother needed from my dad. They fought too often and I never saw them, not once, show any sort of affection toward each other. Because of that, a woman who is affectionate and loving is someone with whom I want to grow old with. I don\u2019t ever want my kids to wonder why mom and dad never hugged, kissed or cuddled, like I always wondered. I want them to know we love each other and they were born from that love.\u201d\u201cIn my mind, a woman with her own life is probably the coolest one to marry. And by 'her own life' I mean: her own career, her own set of friends, her own independent streak, her own dreams, and her own bunch of at least 15\u201320 vinyl records. This would certainly be a fair thing for a woman to want in a potential husband too, by the way.\u201d\u201cShe doesn't punk you in public in general, but particularly in front of your friends.

    "Sign in to comment!By Alicia Acuna, Faith ManganConservative lawmakers working to roll back gun restrictionsConservatives emboldened by election victories are working to roll back gun restrictions in several states, while those on the other side of the debate are claiming success elsewhere in passing initiatives related to gun background checks.On the pro-gun spectrum, for example, Kansas Governor Sam Brownback last week signed a bill to allow Kansans to carry concealed weapons in the state without training or a permit.Second Amendment Foundation founder and Executive Vice President Alan Gottlieb told Fox News, \"I think the voters spoke pretty loud and clear in November and elected a pretty pro-gun rights Congress as well as many statehouses across the country and we're seeing now lots of bills being sponsored...\".On the other side, Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said her group is focused on initiatives it can win with voters, rather than legislators.\"In 2013, we helped close the background check loophole in six states,\" Watts \u00a0said. \"In 2014, we helped pass laws in red and blue states to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers.\"Watts also pointed to the overwhelming passage of Initiative 594 by voters in Washington state last fall. That law expands the federal background check requirement for gun sales to private dealers, such as those now found at gun shows.\"The gun lobby has been so insidious in this country in taking away the responsibilities that go along with gun rights,\" Watts said. She added in an interview with Fox News that the National Rifle Association (NRA) has an annual budget of $350 million.The NRA said that while its operating budget is close to that figure, a \"small fraction\" -- approximately $20 million -- goes toward what it calls 'political activity,' with the bulk spent on safety and training programs.Moms Demand Action works with Everytown for Gun Safety, which is bankrolled by former New York City mayor and billionaire, Michael Bloomberg.Chris W. Cox, executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA), told Fox News, \"Billionaire Michael Bloomberg's tactics may be new, but the fight is the same. The NRA and our five million members stand ready to defend the Second Amendment wherever the battlefield. The majority of Americans do not want more gun control and we will fight tooth and nail to expose Bloomberg's lies and defeat his extreme gun control agenda. \"Prior to those comments, Watts explained her group's mission is about education.\" We're not anti-gun, we're not against the Second Amendment. We're about responsibilities that come along with gun rights and that includes things like background checks and keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people,\" she said.Gottleib, who lives in Washington state where the Second Amendment Foundation is based, acknowledged he is aware of Everytown's tactics for voter initiatives, adding \"...our big concern is buying ballot measures.\"Part of the reason so much action is currently being seen at the state level is the sheer immobility on Capitol Hill. Currently, four national reciprocity bills, three in the House, one in the Senate, are before Congress. Passage of any of them would treat conceal carry permits much like driver's licenses - no matter the state in which it was issued, it would be valid nationwide.But the NRA says right now it is looking more toward 2016 than this year's congressional session. These pieces of legislation need to garner a veto-proof majority because, \"We have a president that hates the Second Amendment\", said Jennifer Baker, a spokeswoman for the NRA.Watts compared the battle over gun rights to a marathon, not a sprint. \"We're not going to find a law to fix every single problem in this country, right. Not every law stops every crime. But what we can do is put more laws in place to ensure things like background checks are happening,\" she said.And as the NRA holds its annual meeting later this week in Nashville, where several presidential contenders are expected to speak, the opposition has its sights set on the future as well. \"We're feeling a huge amount of momentum,\" Watts said. \"Momentum around gun safety in this country and we believe that will continue into 2016 and beyond.\u201dAlicia Acuna joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in 1997 and currently serves as a general assignment reporter based in the network's Denver bureau.45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

    "Sign in to comment!Illinois governor acts to curb power of public sector unionsRepublican Gov. Bruce Rauner struck a first official blow on Monday against the public sector labor unions he has frequently criticized by ordering an end to a requirement that workers pay dues even if they decide not to join a union.His executive order sets up a fight with the state's powerful labor unions, a key ally of members of the Democratic-led Legislature, just as Illinois has begun divided government for the first time in more than a decade. Unions immediately lashed back, while top Democrats questioned the legality of Rauner's action and said their legal teams would review it.Rauner, a wealthy businessman and self-described admirer of governors in Wisconsin and Indiana who've championed anti-union policies, said 6,500 state employees are paying so-called \"fair share\" dues, or an average of $577 a year per worker.Rauner frequently criticized organized labor during his campaign for governor, saying they hinder economic growth by stifling competition and have far too much political influence in President Obama's Democratic-leaning home state.\"These forced union dues are a critical cog in the corrupt bargaining that is crushing taxpayers,\" Rauner said, adding that forcing non-union employees to pay union dues requires them to fund political activity they don't agree with.Rauner said he took action after a U.S. Supreme Court decision last July that found state labor law violated the First Amendment by mandating home health care workers have union dues automatically deducted from their paychecks.The order, Rauner said, would have \"no impact\" on employees who wish to remain paying members of the union and fund union activities out of their paychecks.Rauner said the union dues requirement was something, \"I am duty bound to correct.\"But it was unclear Monday whether Rauner was on solid legal ground, as the Supreme Court decision found certain workers didn't have to pay \"fair share dues\" but upheld that requirement for \"full-fledged state employees.\"Rauner said a legal team headed by a former U.S. attorney and lawyers at Chicago-based firm Winston and Strawn will handle a plan to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to declare \"fair share\" provisions unconstitutional.Unions pledged to stand together to reverse the order. Rauner can be overruled by the courts, or if lawmakers can gather enough votes to override his decision. Democrats hold supermajorities in the state Legislature.The executive order followed Rauner's proposal last week, during his State of the State Address, for Illinois to adopt \"right to work\" zones around the state where communities are able to decide whether joining a union or paying union fees would be voluntary for local workers.\"This is really a smoke-screen for what the billionaire governor wants to achieve,\" Tom Balanoff, President of Service Employees' International Union Local 1 said. \"He wants to bring right to work to this state. It's going to lower peoples' wages, lower their benefits.\"Roberta Lynch, Executive Director of AFSCME Council 31, called the executive order a \"scheme\" to weaken unions and strip state workers of their rights.Some members of the Democratic-led Legislature suggested it was a distraction as Rauner grapples with an unprecedented budget crisis stemming from the expiration of the state's income tax increase in January. The expiration of the tax increase is expected to leave the state with close to a $2 billion budget hole by the end of the fiscal year this July, and more next year, leaving key programs and services underfunded.\"I don't understand why he wants to throw down the gauntlet on an issue like this,\" said House Majority Leader Barbara Flynn Currie, a Chicago Democrat. \"He should have enough on his plate.\"45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

They have settled the issue,\" the unidentified spokesman said.\nBoth pilots have been removed from duty following the incident, Sky News reported.\"Both the pilots have been derostered. An inquiry has been ordered into this,\" the spokesman for the airline said.The co-pilot has reportedly faced similar charges in the past, senior Air India commanders said.\"Three years back, he asked the commander of a flight to come out of the cockpit, remove the stars on his shirt collar (epaulettes) and then fought with him. A year later, another commander complained about his 'rude and unbecoming' behavior in the cockpit and questioned his state of mind,\" an unidentified senior commander told the Times of India.Neither the DGCA chief nor her deputies could be reached for comment on the incident.

    "What do you plan to do with your tax refund? Do you have your eye on some new furniture or a relaxing vacation \u2014 or do you plan to use your refund to pay for the furniture that you already purchased and the vacation that you have already taken?Of course, paying down debt is the more responsible path. According to a recent poll by The National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC), a majority of Americans plan to take that more responsible path with this year\u2019s tax refund. Almost 7 in 10 (68%) of the 1,121 respondents indicated that they would use their refund to pay down debt, while only 2% said they would use the money to take a vacation or go shopping.In other poll responses, 15% plan to use the refund for basic necessities, 11% plan to save the money, and another 4% are not sure how they plan to use their refund.In some ways, this is good news, because paying down debt should be the highest priority choice if you do not have to use your refund for necessities. The NFCC is looking at the poll from the overall debt perspective by pointing out that over six times as many respondents are applying their tax refund to debt compared to savings. According to NFCC spokesman Bruce McClary, \u201cThese poll results indicate that debt is still getting in the way of personal savings for many Americans.\u201dFor perspective, consider that the average 2014 individual tax refund was $3,034 while the average 2014 credit card debt was $5,047. Applying every bit of tax refund money toward debt would knock the average debt down by over half, but still leave the average American with over $2,000 in debt.A shift toward debt repayment is a welcome conclusion for the NFCC and similar credit/debt counseling agencies. Merchants and economists may find this statistic alarming, since consumer spending drives the majority of the U.S. economy. However, there are two things to keep in mind when assessing this poll.1. Intent\u00a0\u2013 The poll is saying what people plan to do with a tax refund this year, not what they did with a tax refund. Sometimes, plans go out the window when a check is burning a hole in your pocket.2. Location\u00a0\u2013 The poll was conducted through the front page of the NFCC website. Therefore, anybody who sees the poll question at all has taken the time to contact a website regarding credit counseling. It may be possible that the poll respondents have more pressing debt to deal with and have a more responsible attitude about paying it down, compared to the general public. Psychology may also play a part \u2014 you may expect paying down debt is the \u201cright\u201d answer in the context of a credit-counseling website.We suspect that if this poll were taken later to find out what people actually did with their tax refund and was an actively random survey of Americans, the responses would probably be different. However, the recent drop in gas prices and the resulting spending patterns do suggest a more conservative trend. People are applying their gas savings toward increasing their savings accounts and paying down debt instead of simply going on spending sprees, so it is logical to assume the same thing will occur with tax refunds.In any case, to us this poll reflects good news. Reduction of debt is almost always a positive thing. Let\u2019s hope debt reduction really is a trend.More from MoneyTips.comRefund Anticipation Loans and Checks 101\nFinancial Benefits of Investing Your Tax Refund\nTop 8 Ways to Cut Your Taxes this Year+ FollowFox Business on FacebookMore\u203aInvesting\u203a",

At the time, those people were asked to hold off on filing their taxes for 2014 until a corrected form could be sent out.It was not immediately clear how many people had requested or received an extension. At the time the Obama administration acknowledged the error, around 50,000 people had already filed their tax return using the incorrect forms.A Health and Human Services official told Fox News that taxpayers should receive the corrected forms during the first week of March. However, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which is overseeing the ObamaCare rollout, told The Hill that it had taken longer than expected to mail the proper forms.Federal officials had previously announced an extended grace period for people who face a penalty for not having health insurance.

    "Sign in to comment!March 11, 2015 - Members of paramilitary National Guard muster near Szczecin, Poland, as they ready to counter threats and contain crisis situations in their area. Across many eastern European nations, ordinary people are heeding a call to receive military training in case of war, backed by NATO forces on a mission to reassure citizens they\u2019re safe from Russian aggression.\u00a0(The Associated Press)WARSAW, Poland \u2013 \u00a0NATO aircraft scream across eastern European skies and American armored vehicles rumble near the border with Russia on a mission to reassure citizens that they're safe from Russian aggression.But these days, ordinary people aren't taking any chances.In Poland, doctors, shopkeepers, lawmakers and others are heeding a call to receive military training in case of an invasion. Neighboring Lithuania is restoring the draft and teaching citizens what to do in case of war. Nearby Latvia has plans to give university students military training next year.The drive to teach ordinary people how to use weapons and take cover under fire reflects soaring anxiety among people in a region where memories of Moscow's domination \u2014 which ended only in the 1990s \u2014 remain raw. People worry that their security and hard-won independence are threatened as saber-rattling intensifies between the West and Russia over the conflict in Ukraine, where more than 6,000 people have died.In Poland, the oldest generation remembers the Soviet Army's invasion in 1939, at the start of World War II. Younger people remain traumatized by the repression of the communist regime that lasted more than four decades.It's a danger felt across the EU newcomer states that border Russia.\"There's a real feeling of threat in our society,\" Latvian defense ministry spokeswoman Aija Jakubovska told The Associated Press. Military training for students is a \"way we can increase our own defense capabilities.\"Most people are still looking to NATO's military umbrella as their main guarantor of security. Zygmunt Wos waved goodbye to a detachment of U.S. armored vehicles leaving the eastern Polish city of Bialystok with apprehension: \"These troops should be staying with us,\" he said, \"not going back to Germany.\"Poland has been at the forefront of warnings about the dangers of the Ukraine conflict. Just 17 hours by car from the battle zone, Poland has stepped up efforts to upgrade its weapons arsenal, including a possible purchase of U.S.-made Tomahawk missiles. It will host a total of some 10,000 NATO and other allied troops for exercises this year. Its professional army is 100,000-strong, and 20,000 reservists are slated for test-range training.It's the grassroots mobilization, however, that best demonstrates the fears: The government has reached out to some 120 paramilitary groups with tens of thousands of members, who are conducting their own drills, in an effort to streamline them with the army exercises.In an unprecedented appeal, Parliament Speaker Radek Sikorski urged lawmakers to train at a test range in May, while Defense Minister Tomasz Siemoniak called on men and women aged between 18 and 50, and with no military experience, to sign up for test-range exercise. So far, over 2,000 people have responded.\"The times are dangerous and we must do all we can to raise Poland's ability to defend its territory,\" President Bronislaw Komorowski said during a recent visit to a military unit.The Poles believe they have grounds for feeling particularly vulnerable because they have been invaded by Russia repeatedly since the 18th century. Russian leader Vladimir Putin seems to have singled out Poland, a staunch U.S. ally, as a prime enemy in the struggle over Ukraine, accusing it of training \"Ukrainian nationalists\" and instigating unrest.Recently Moscow said it will place state-of-the-art Iskander missiles in its Kaliningrad enclave, bordering Poland and Lithuania, for a major exercise.Last week, over 550 young Polish reservists were summoned on one hour's notice to a military base for a mobilization drill. In their 20s and 30s, in jeans and sneakers, the men and women arrived at a base in Tarnowskie Gory, in southern Poland for days of shooting practice. One of them, 35-year-old former soldier Krystian Studnia, said the call was \"absolutely natural.\"\"Everyone should be willing and ready to fight to defend his country,\" he said.In Warsaw, Mateusz Warszczak, 23, glowed with excitement as he signed up at a recruitment center. \"I want to be ready to defend my family, my relatives, from danger,\" he said.Even older Poles feel obliged to take responsibility for their own safety.In September, Wojciech Klukowski, a 58-year-old medical doctor, and his friends organized a civic militia group of about 50 men and women of various ages, and called it the National Guard. They practiced skirmishes and shooting, with the aim of becoming citizen-soldiers in their hometown of Szczecin, on the Baltic Sea coast.\"We do not feel fully safe,\" Klukowski said. \"Many people ... want to be trained to defend their homes, their work places, their families.\"",

    "Monday, April 6, 2015 as of 7:03 PM EDTCongressman Mike Coffman has been studying Spanish for less than two years, but he launches into it with the seeming comfort and ability of a veteran speaker.The Colorado Republican, who won re-election in 2014 in what was considered the most competitive House race in the country, drew some skepticism when he began taking Spanish and going to Latino neighborhoods and adopting a more moderate view of issues such as comprehensive immigration reform.His district\u2019s boundaries were redrawn in 2011, after the Census came out a year earlier, and suddenly the predominantly white, Republican area was ethnically diverse \u2013 including 20 percent Latino \u2013 and was winnable by a Democrat.That made last year's mid-term election, as Politico put it, \"a proxy war for the national Democratic and Republican parties\" in the battle for the growing Latino electorate.Coffman, 60, does not deny that the need to reach out to Latinos, a community he concedes that he knew very little about, was non-negotiable if he was to remain in Congress.But what began as a survival tactic, Coffman said, developed into a genuine interest and respect for Latinos and the Spanish language.Where many politicians drop such outreach and nearly vanish from certain communities once an election is over, Coffman, who won re-election in 2012 and 2014, engages with Latinos and studies the language as if he were still campaigning.\u201cEs muy importante para la comunidad,\u201d Coffman said in an interview with Fox News Latino where the questions were in English but he often responded in Spanish.\u201cIt\u2019s a sign of respect for the community,\u201d he said, translating his response to why he dove into learning Spanish, a language he continues to study several times a week with his Colombian-born tutor. \u201cIt\u2019s been exciting for me to reach out to Hispanics, Asians, African immigrants and learn.\u201d\u201cMy district totally, dramatically changed,\u201d Coffman said. \u201cI lost a lot of my more Republican areas, and got a heavy immigrant population.\u201dSuddenly, he was addressing issues such as immigration from a perspective he had lacked before.Now, he was formulating his views and ideas after speaking directly \u2013 without translators \u2013 in Spanish to families separated after deportations, and undocumented youths who had been in the United States since they were children and shared with him their despair over not being able to go to college or get a driver\u2019s license because of actions their parents had taken.Coffman says he was taken aback by the chilly reaction he got at first by some Latinos and Asians to whom he made overtures.\u201cThey said to me that Republicans were anti-immigrant,\u201d he said, \u201cthat was the Republican Party\u2019s image even among legal immigrants. That surprised me as I was campaigning.\u201dCoffman and Romanoff made national headlines with their decision to hold an all-Spanish televised debate, a rarity in the country. Univision promoted it weeks ahead of time, something that Coffman says made him more known to Latinos in his district.The Coffman success in a diverse district has the national Republican Party watching closely.The Republican National Committee is holding Coffman up as a model for the kind of engagement Republicans must employ if they are to turn around their image among Latinos.\u201cAt the RNC we\u2019re leading by example, while shining a spotlight on leaders who go the extra mile,\" RNC Chairman Reince Priebus told a large audience at an annual U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce summit in Washington D.C. last month.\u00a0\n\u201cLike Congressman Mike Coffman in Colorado. He was first elected to Colorado\u2019s sixth district in 2008. When that district was redrawn after 2010, he found he had an even larger Spanish-speaking constituency,\" Priebus said. \u201cFor Congressman Coffman, communicating with these constituents was important. He wanted to do his part. So he took intensive Spanish courses, and in the last election, he even participated in a Spanish language debate on Univision. And he\u2019s still continuing his classes.\"\n\u201cIn states like Colorado and Florida, that work made an important difference in securing Republican victories.\"Coffman has softened his stance on immigration. In the past he expressed opposition to giving undocumented immigrants a break, and did not support the DREAM Act.Now he supports allowing immigrants who were brought to the United States as children a chance to legalize if, among other things, they are willing to join the military or go to college.\u201cThey were brought here through no fault of their own, and this is the only country many of them really know,\u201d Coffman said.Other undocumented immigrants, he said, should have an opportunity to obtain work visas and pay taxes.\u201cIt can\u2019t be done by executive order\u201d however, Coffman said. \u201cIt has to be done by Congress.\u201dBut neither the Democrats nor his own party seem to have the will to address immigration in a rational, efficient way, he said.\u201cFor Democrats, it\u2019s all or nothing,\u201d Coffman said. \u201cRepublicans want a step-by-step approach to reforming immigration, but they seem unwilling to take a first step.\u201dHe is working with colleagues such as Rep. Carlos Curbelo, a Florida Republican, on measures that would give some immigrants a chance to legalize their status if they meet strict criteria.\u201cWe need to come up with a version of the DREAM Act that is acceptable to both parties,\u201d he said.\u201cWe need a system where people can go back and forth, bring them out of the shadows, let them work here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to get something done on immigration reform, something that is aligned with our economic needs, and we need to be compassionate about keeping families together. It\u2019s important going into 2016.\u201dDuring the campaign for re-election last year, Democrats accused Coffman of being insincere.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said his change of heart on some issues of importance to Latinos amounted to a \"political deathbed conversion.\u201d\u201cMike Coffman, from his record and his past, has shown that he\u2019s not on the right side on immigration,\u201d said Rick Palacio, the Colorado Democratic Party chairman, to Politico. \u201cGoing from that extreme to trying to soften his stance says to me and to a lot of people in Colorado that he\u2019s a political opportunist.\u201dCoffman dismissed the criticism, saying that many of his GOP colleagues, like many Americans in general, were modifying their views on the complex issue of immigration.Bob Martinez, a former Colorado Republican Party chairman who often pushed for his party to be open-minded on immigration, defended Coffman's altered views.\u201cI think it\u2019s good. I\u2019m hoping a lot of Republican politicians realize how damaging to the party [the issue has] been,\u201d Martinez said to Politico. \u201cMike Coffman has made a 180-degree evolution on this issue. \u2026 I think it\u2019s fantastic.\u201dHad Coffman not changed, Martinez added, \u201cI think it would have put him in jeopardy.\u201dFor now, Coffman continues immersing himself in the Latino cultures and Spanish language.He listens to Rosetta Stone lessons on flights between Washington D.C. and Colorado. He watches \u201cSabado Gigante\u201d and Spanish-language news shows. And he regularly meets with Latinos groups and officials of the Mexican consulate.This summer, he plans to attend an intensive Spanish-language class in Mexico.\u201cIf it goes well,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll do it again for a longer time.\u201dElizabeth Llorente can be reached at elizabeth.llorente@foxnewslatino.com.

    "Sign in to comment!By Brooke CrothersTesla Motors CEO Elon Musk talks at the Automotive World News Congress at the Renaissance Center in Detroit, Michigan, Jan.13, 2015.\u00a0(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)Innovate or perish may be the most apt phrase for Elon Musk and his push to reshape the car,\u00a0 space, and transport industries.As the CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX, Musk has shown his exceptional abilities as innovator. Tesla, for example, Tesla\u2019s 2010 IPO was the first by an American automobile maker to IPO in more than 50 years, defying a chorus of critics and naysayers.Tesla: The best way to describe the all-electric Tesla Model S is a computer on wheels.\u00a0 Though many cars today are packed with computer technology, Tesla has upped the ante with an electric drive train running off a large battery pack.The electric drive system includes a battery, motor, drive inverter, a gearbox, and a microprocessor-controlled lithium-ion battery pack.\u00a0 The battery comes in different sizes with the largest rated at more than 250 miles on a single charge.And with no valves, connecting rods, gears, clutches, and other legacy components of the gasoline car, in many ways the Model S bears little resemblance to a conventional automobile.\u00a0 And at some level, it\u2019s not unlike a laptop computer \u2013 also packed to the gills with battery cells.\u201cWe really designed the Model S to be a very sophisticated computer on wheels,\u201d Musk said earlier this month when announcing updates to the Model S in a conference call.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cA huge part of what Tesla is, is a Silicon Valley software company. We view this the same as updating your phone or your laptop,\u201d he said.During the call, Musk also made it clear how different Tesla is than the typical car from Detroit. With a wireless software update (again, not unlike a laptop), Musk said an \"auto steering\" feature is on the way that that should be ready in a few months. With the new updates, steering, acceleration, and braking would be automatically controlled when the car is on a highway.But the Model S is just the beginning.\u00a0 The Model X, a crossover, is due in early 2016.\u00a0 After that, in 2017, the Model 3, the first mass market Tesla, is scheduled to arrive.\u00a0 The Model 3 is expected to be priced at around $35,000, according to Auto Express, essentially cutting the price of the $70,000 Model S in half.Innovation also extends to the way Tesla sells its cars.\u00a0 The company has been waging a state by state battle to sell its cars directly to the consumer and bypass the age-old dealer network that Detroit and foreign car makers still rely on.SpaceX: SpaceX\u2019s goals make Tesla\u2019s aspirations seem tame.\u00a0 The ultimate aim of the privately-held company is to colonize Mars. In the meantime, its more down-to-earth mission is to reduce space transportation costs.The company\u2019s core products are the SpaceX-designed-and-built Falcon rockets and Dragon spacecraft.Falcon 9: the key to reducing costs is making the Falcon rocket reusable. \u201cThe majority of the launch cost comes from building the rocket, which flies only once. Compare that to a commercial airliner \u2013 each new plane costs about the same as Falcon 9, but can fly multiple times per day, and conduct tens of thousands of flights over its lifetime. Following the commercial model, a rapidly reusable space launch vehicle could reduce the cost of traveling to space by a hundredfold,\u201d according to a SpaceX statement.Falcon 9 made history in 2012 when it became the first commercial company to visit the International Space Station (ISS).\u00a0 Earlier this year, on Jan. 10, the Falcon 9 rocket successfully delivered a large cargo to the Space Station.\u00a0 And the company will be busy this year.\u00a0 SpaceX is slated for multiple launches in in 2015.Dragon Version 2: The Dragon Version 2 spacecraft, announced last year, epitomizes SpaceX\u2019s future.\u00a0 Designed to carry astronauts \u201cto Earth orbit and beyond.\u201d According to SpaceX, the spacecraft \u201cwill be capable of carrying up to seven crewmembers, landing propulsively almost anywhere on Earth, and refueling and flying again for rapid reusability.\u201dUpgrades over Version 1 include a SpaceX-designed and built ISS docking adapter, impact attenuating landing legs, and a more advanced version of the PICA-X (Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator-X) heat shield for improved durability and performance.Dragon v2\u2019s robust thermal protection system is capable of lunar missions, in addition to flights to and from Earth orbit, according to SpaceX.Unbelievably, though, Musk isn\u2019t limiting his ambitions to the already-ambitious Tesla and SpaceX ventures.Hyperloop: Mostly a vision at this stage, Musk\u2019s idea is to develop Hyperloop, a next-generation transit system. Essentially, it is a network of tubes, kept at low air pressure, making the journey between, for example, Los Angeles and San Francisco doable in about 35 minutes by reaching speeds of up to 760 mph.The first phase of realizing the vision is the construction of a small scale hyperloop next year. The plan is to build a five-mile track in Quay Valley in California\u2019s Central Valley.\u00a0 Construction will be funded by a $100 million public offering Hyperloop Transportation Technologies plans for later this year.If Tesla and SpaceX are any lesson, Hyperloop is not an idle vision.\u00a0 In fact, Musk\u2019s motto might be something like, \u201cHey, somebody\u2019s gotta do it.\u201d In all three cases, Musk is not only creating \u2013 or trying to create \u2013 a groundbreaking product, but creating pioneering industries.

Republican establishment frontrunner Jeb Bush is trying to show that he can be as good at running for president as his older brother. The former Florida governor is even using a similar outreach to evangelical voters to replicate George W. Bush\u2019s 2000 success. But for Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, the question is instead how he can differ from his famous father, former Texas Rep. Ron Paul, who unsuccessfully sought the GOP nomination in 2008 and 2012. As the younger Paul makes ready for his Tuesday announcement, his campaign offers a trailer-style video in which he promises to be \u201ca different kind of Republican.\u201d His father was certainly that. The question for the son is whether he can be more successful.\n[Watch Fox: Chris Stirewalt joins\u00a0\u201cThe Real Story\u201d in the 2 p.m. ET hour with the latest on who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down in the 2016 Power Index.]\nAs the latest round of polls shows, Paul is in about the same spot his dad was in 2012: lots of buzz and fired-up grassroots support but with numbers in the high single digits. Can he change the trajectory and broaden his appeal without losing the core libertarian support he inherited from his father? How does Paul reach out to get in the top tier without seeing his base crumble underneath him? So far, Paul has been given remarkable latitude to reach a truce with the GOP establishment and to even modify stances on core positions, particularly with a recent call for a huge hike in Defense spending. There\u2019s danger, though, in the form of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who has publicly feuded with Paul in the past and is now targeting the same group of voters as Paul. While Paul has latitude in dealing with ultra-hawk Cruz, Cruz will certainly be poised to hit Paul for any other perceived apostasies. Cruz\u2019s candidacy will be a limiting reagent for Paul\u2019s.\nPaul\u2019s best argument in the months to come will likely center on general-election viability. If his core supporters and media backers can keep Paul in the game through the early debate rounds, he can position himself as a chance worth taking for a party desperate to regain the White House. As last week\u2019s Quinnipiac University polls show, Paul connects with the general electorate in a way that frontrunners Bush and Gov. Scott Walker struggle to do. If there is a problem at the top of the pack and Paul has maintained his viability through the first furlongs of the race, he might end up in the discussion. At the very least, Paul is poised to be near the top of the short list for running mates, particularly if Bush is the nominee. And wouldn\u2019t that be fitting? Rand Paul would help Jeb Bush exorcise the foreign policy problems he inherited from brother while Jeb Bush helped Rand Paul unload the baggage from his famous name.\nGraham praises Hillary, disses Rand -\u00a0During an appearance on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he wanted to blow up the nuclear deal with Iran so President Obama\u2019s successor could start over: \u201cThe best deal, I think, comes with a new president. Hillary Clinton would do better. I think everybody on our side, except maybe Rand Paul, could do better,\u201d Graham said.\nFIRST IN FOX NEWS FIRST: HUCKABEE TARGETS MIDDLE CLASS WITH \u2018MAXIMUM WAGE\u2019\nIn his first in a series of videos, former Gov. Mike Huckabee, R-Ark, makes his pitch to the middle class by offering his solutions to low wages and high unemployment.\u00a0In the video provided first to Fox News First, Huckabee shares the story of an unemployed Texas woman who states, \u201cI don\u2019t have to be on welfare because I know if you believe and you have faith it will come.\u201d In casting his vision for what he calls a \u201cmaximum wage\u201d Huckabee appears saying, \u201cI\u2019m not a Republican because I grew up rich, I\u2019m a Republican because I didn\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life poor, waiting for the government to rescue me,\u201d adding, \u201cInstead of fighting over the minimum wage, why don\u2019t we focus on solutions that help every American earn his or her maximum wage.\u201d Huckabee takes a back seat to no one in the GOP field on social issues, but has a greater gift for making his case without saying incendiary things. This move to roll out his economic strategy in a way that\u2019s accessible to voters, however, is a much-needed step in Huckabee\u2019s broader outreach.\nWhoops -\u00a0NYT: \u201c[Jeb Bush] a former Florida governor and likely [Republican] presidential candidate, was born in Texas and hails from one of America\u2019s most prominent political dynasties. But on at least one occasion, it appears he got carried away with his appeal to Spanish-speaking voters and claimed he actually was Hispanic. In a 2009 voter-registration application, obtained from the Miami-Dade County Elections Department, Mr. Bush marked Hispanic in the field labeled \u2018race/ethnicity.\u201d\u2019\n2016 GOP Power Index: This week\u2019s ranking\u2026\n1)\u00a0Jeb Bush; 2)\u00a0Scott Walker; 3)\u00a0Rand Paul [+2]; 4)\u00a0Marco Rubio; 5) Ted Cruz [-2]; 6)\u00a0Mike Huckabee [+2]; 7)\u00a0John Kasich [-1]; 8)\u00a0Carly Fiorina\u00a0[-1]; 9)\u00a0Rick Perry\u00a0[-1]; 10)\u00a0Chris Christie\nOn the Radar -\u00a0Ben Carson, Rick Santorum,\u00a0Bobby Jindal\nWhat would you say?\u00a0- Give us your take on the GOP field and we will share the best and brightest with the whole class.

At the end of the game there is no dispute over who won or lost. The teams and their fans do not get to walk away with a conflicting set of facts.

Finney has been part of Clinton\u2019s shadow campaign network since last year following the cancellation of Finney\u2019s short-lived MSNBC show \u201cDisrupt.\u201d During her television career, Finney was famous for pulling no punches and partisan attacks. Finney once referred to \u201ccrazy crackers on the right\u201d who opposed a comprehensive immigration bill and another time likened Republicans to the defenders of Apartheid. Clinton, who has reportedly selected a campaign headquarters, is expected to make her candidacy official in the next week or two.\n[The Finney hire, first reported by CNN and confirmed to Fox News, is paired with that of Oren Shur, who managed Gov.

    "Sign in to comment!Hillary Rodham Clinton is expected to launch her campaign for president sometime in the next two weeks and will initially focus on intimate events, rather than soaring speeches to big rallies, as her team looks to put her in direct contact with voters in states with early primaries or caucuses.The goal, according to two people close to the Clinton organization, is to make Clinton's second run for the White House more about voters and less about herself.While it appears at this moment that Clinton will not face a tough primary challenge in 2016, she is aiming to show voters she plans to earn their support and won't take the Democratic Party's nomination for granted.The strategy is also aimed at playing to what Clinton allies see as her strengths. Friends and advisers have long said she is more at ease in small group settings and one-on-one conversations where she can display her policy expertise, as well as personal warmth that she sometimes struggles to convey in front of larger crowds.When Clinton ran for Senate in 2000, she kicked off her campaign with a listening tour across New York state.The approach also comes with risks. More loosely scripted appearances increase the chances that Clinton could be drawn off message or make a misstep that causes a distraction for the campaign. The former secretary of state has also been off the campaign trail for years, and she seemed rusty in fielding questions during interviews on a book tour last year.The exact date of Clinton's launch is a closely guarded secret, but the announcement is expected by mid-April. Clinton aides have been checking in with longtime supporters on their whereabouts this month and Democratic operatives in Iowa and New Hampshire have essentially been put on standby.Clinton may make the official announcement with an online video or social media post, though those plans are still being finalized. She is expected to quickly hit the campaign trail, with stops in Iowa and New Hampshire.It's unclear whether Clinton's husband, former president Bill Clinton, and her daughter, Chelsea, will hold solo events in the campaign's early stages.Those familiar with the campaign plans insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the details on the record.45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

    "Sign in to comment!Rolling Stone retracts UVA rape story after reviewPhi Kappa Psi, the fraternity at the center of the discredited Rolling Stone magazine story about an alleged gang rape at the University of Virginia, said Monday it plans to pursue \"all available legal action\" against the magazine.\"Our fraternity and its members have been defamed,\" chapter president Stephen Scipione said in a statement.The fraternity called the story \"reckless,\" saying that the article was viewed by millions, led to members being ostracized and there was vandalism of the fraternity house.Rolling Stone late Sunday formally retracted the discredited story about the alleged rape at Phi Kappa Psi after an independent review dubbed the article a \"journalistic failure.\"The review, undertaken by the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism at Rolling Stone's request, produced a 12,000-word report that documented lapses in standard journalistic procedure at every level of the magazine during the reporting and editing of the story.The report was authored by dean Steve Coll and academic dean Sheila Coronel.\"I think the real casualty of the report is the University of Virginia's trust in journalism,\" said Abraham Axler of New York City, president of the university's Student Council. \"I don't think any University of Virginia student going through this will ever read an article the same way.\"\"The abject failure of accountability in journalism that led to Rolling Stone's 'A Rape on Campus' article has done untold damage to the University of Virginia and our Commonwealth as a whole,\" Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said in a statement Monday. \"More importantly, this false account has been an unnecessary and dangerous distraction from real efforts to combat sexual violence on our college campuses. My administration will not allow this shameful episode to stop the momentum we have built working with administrators, law enforcement, students and advocates to keep our campuses safe.\"The article, published in the magazine's November 19, 2014 issue, focused on a student identified only as \"Jackie,\" who said she was raped by seven men at a fraternity house. It also described a hidden culture of sexual violence fueled by binge drinking at one of the nation's most highly regarded public universities.The report found, among other things, that Rolling Stone did not try hard enough to find the person Jackie accused of orchestrating the assault. The report also detailed how writer Sabrina Erdely failed to contact three friends of Jackie whom the story depicted as dissuading her from seeking medical treatment or reporting the alleged gang rape to police.The report said that contacting the three friends \"was the reporting path, if taken, that would almost certainly have led the magazine\u2019s editors to change plans.\"However, Coll told The Washington Post that there was no evidence of dishonest reporting. As Coll put it, there was no \"inventing facts, lying to colleagues, plagiarism or such, that I would think of as grounds for automatic firing or serious sanction.\"Rolling Stone Managing Editor Will Dana is quoted as saying in the report, \"It\u2019s not like I think we need to overhaul our process, and I don\u2019t think we need to necessarily institute a lot of new ways of doing things. We just have to do what we\u2019ve always done and just make sure we don\u2019t make this mistake again.\"Jann Wenner, Rolling Stone's founder and publisher, told The New York Times that Erdely would continue to write for the magazine and called Jackie \"a really expert fabulist storyteller.\"Obviously there is something here that is untruthful,\" Wenner said of the story's main source, \"and something sits at her doorstep.\"Dana said magazine officials are \"committing ourselves to a series of recommendations about journalistic practices that are spelled out in the report.\"Erdely also apologized in a statement, saying she would not repeat the mistakes she made when writing the article and \"did not go far enough to verify\" Jackie's story.\"Reading the Columbia account of the mistakes and misjudgments in my reporting was a brutal and humbling experience,\" she said.The independent review began after news media organizations, particularly The Washington Post, exposed flaws in the article, titled \"A Rape on Campus.\" By Dec. 5, Rolling Stone apologized and acknowledged discrepancies in the article.A four-month police investigation produced no evidence that the attack occurred. Jackie refused to cooperate in the police investigation.\"We would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout, including members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and UVA administrators and students,\" Dana wrote on the publication's website.\"Sexual assault is a serious problem on college campuses, and it is important that rape victims feel comfortable stepping forward. It saddens us to think that their willingness to do so might be diminished by our failings.\"Dana and Erdely said they had been too accommodating of requests from Jackie that limited their ability to report the story because she said she was a rape victim and asked them not to contact others to corroborate, the report said.Despite its flaws, the article heightened scrutiny of campus sexual assaults amid a campaign by President Barack Obama. The University of Virginia had already been on the Department of Education's list of 55 colleges under investigation for their handling of sex assault violations.The article also prompted university President Teresa Sullivan to temporarily suspend fraternity and sorority social events. Fraternities later agreed to ban kegs, hire security workers and keep at least three fraternity members sober at each event.In a statement Sunday, Sullivan said the Rolling Stone article \"did nothing to combat sexual violence, and it damaged serious efforts to address the issue. Irresponsible journalism unjustly damaged the reputations of many innocent individuals and the University of Virginia.Maggie Rossberg, a second-year nursing student from Crozet, Virginia, said her chief concern is the effect the journalistic lapses will have on rape victims. \"This is probably going to discourage other sexual assault survivors from coming forward,\" Rossberg said.During a press conference Monday, Coll said it \"would be a really unfortunate outcome if journalists backed away from doing this kind of reporting\" based on the Rolling Stone incident.\"These false accusations have been extremely damaging to our entire organization, but we can only begin to imagine the setback this must have dealt to survivors of sexual assault,\" said Stephen Scipione, president of the Virginia Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi, after the Charlottesville police suspended their investigation.For its part, Rolling Stone declined to discuss whether the story had undergone legal review.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Click for more from The Washington Post.",
    "Sign in to comment!By Howard KurtzKurtz: When activists peddle hateThe Indiana pizza uproar is still giving me indigestion.Just when gay rights advocates had won a victory by getting Mike Pence and the Indiana legislature to modify their religious freedom law, left-wing zealots harassed the poor folks at Memories Pizza into temporarily shutting down.As you probably know, the contretemps began when Crystal O\u2019Connor, one of the shop\u2019s owners, told a local ABC station that they wouldn\u2019t provide pies for a gay wedding. As she later told Neil Cavuto,\u00a0\u201cIt is not a sin that we bring gays into our establishment and to serve them. It is a sin, though, if we cater their wedding. We feel we are participating, we are putting a stamp of approval on their wedding.\u201dBy answering that hypothetical question, O\u2019Connor unleashed an outpouring of hate on social media. Yelp was flooded with such images as Hitler holding a pizza and Jesus holding up a middle finger. \u201cAvoid this place like the Plague,\u201d one person wrote. \u201cSounds to me like a memory of owning a pizza place is all the owners going to have after this idiocy,\u201d said another.Now I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to blame this on \u201cthe left.\u201d It\u2019s not that liberal commentators or leading activists were mounting a crusade against the pizzeria, it\u2019s these morons who spew venom, often anonymously, with nasty tweets, nasty emails, and now nasty restaurant \u201creviews.\u201dI get that Crystal O\u2019Connor\u2019s business may not have a legal right to refuse service, not that there\u2019s a great demand for sausage and pepperoni at gay weddings or any other kind of wedding. But she wasn\u2019t even expressing animosity toward gays and lesbians, just explaining her Christian beliefs.This reinforces my view that the clashes in Indiana and Arkansas were largely about the politics of symbolism. Whether you\u2019re more concerned about religious liberty or about gay rights, how many bakers and florists could have been affected by the Indiana law as originally signed, before a media and business backlash prompted Pence to accept gay rights language in the revised measure?But the larger problem is that too many on the left want to silence free speech or punish those whose beliefs are deemed unacceptable. You see this every time a campus protest forces a conservative speaker to cancel an appearance\u2014and that should depress honest liberals who once fervently fought for free speech.Remember last year, when pressure from gay activists and boycott threats forced Brendan Eich to resign as CEO of the browser company Mozilla? His sin was to make a donation to the 2008 Prop 8 campaign in California, which succeeded at the time in banning gay marriage.Keep in mind that those who don\u2019t support gay marriage are being denounced and hounded for taking the same position that Barack Obama espoused until 2012.Same-sex marriage is now legal in 37 states, and with young people increasingly seeing it as a non-issue, that trend will undoubtedly continue. But it\u2019s important for all of us, in the media and elsewhere, to respect the views of a significant number of Americans who don\u2019t agree.On Crystal O\u2019Connor and the pizza controversy, the Atlantic\u2019s Conor Friedersdorf, a gay marriage supporter, frames the question around small-business owners as \u201cshould we destroy their livelihoods\u201d:\u201cThe owners of Memories Pizza are, I think, mistaken in what their Christian faith demands of them. And I believe their position on gay marriage to be wrongheaded. But I also believe that the position\u00a0I'll gladly serve any gay customers but I feel my faith compels me to refrain from catering a gay wedding\u00a0is less hateful or intolerant than\u00a0let's go burn that family's business to the ground.\u201cAnd I believe that the subset of the gay-rights movement intent on destroying their business and livelihood has done more harm than good here\u2014that they've shifted their focus from championing historic advances for justice to perpetrating small injustices against marginal folks on the other side of the culture war.\u201dBut liberal Washington Post columnist Gene Robinson likens the debate to the civil rights movement:\u201cIt is her right to believe whatever she wants. Religious liberty is guaranteed by the Constitution. But in a pluralistic society, freedom of worship cannot mean a business that serves the general public can discriminate. When I was growing up in the South, there were business owners who believed the Lord didn\u2019t intend for different races to mix, much less marry. Federal civil rights legislation barred these businesses from acting on that belief. The proprietors got over it.\u201dBut National Review\u2019s Jonah Goldberg says that critics of these religious freedom laws are going overboard:\u201cComparing RFRA laws to Jim Crow laws turns all of this on its head. Jim Crow laws forced tolerant businesses to be intolerant of blacks. No one, anywhere, is suggesting that people who want to do business with same-sex couples should be barred from doing so. The argument is whether the government should force a few ardent Christians (or Jews or Muslims) to participate in a ceremony that violates their faith.\u201dRush Limbaugh is escalating matters further, saying the battle is part of \u201cthe Democrats\u2019 war on Christianity\u201d because \u201cthey resent that Christianity provides a repository for faith and confidence in something other than government, which is where they want all power localized.\u201dI get that passions are running high. But if Republicans and Democrats were able to find a compromise in Indianapolis, perhaps we could all lower the temperature a bit\u2014and that includes those who think it\u2019s great sport to harass a small pizza shop owner.Click for more from Media Buzz45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

    "Sign in to comment!Family of missing co-ed: Police 'doing nothing' to find herThe grandmother of a missing Virginia college student said she's convinced foul play is to blame for the disappearance of her 18-year-old granddaughter who was last seen a month ago near her parents' home in Norfolk.Anjelica \"AJ\" Hadsell, a freshman at Longwood University in Farmville, Va., was spotted by a neighbor March 2 while walking in her parents' neighborhood, according to police. She hasn't been seen or heard from since.\"I'm absolutely convinced there's foul play,\" Katherine Hadsell, the woman's grandmother, told FoxNews.com Monday. \"This is so far out of character for her.\"\"She is a young lady who is living her life as any 18-year-old would,\" said Hadsell, who also lives in Norfolk. \"She loves her mom and dad so much and is very close with her family. It\u2019s not possible she ran away.\"Virginia authorities, meanwhile, say they are considering \"all possibilities\" in their hunt for Hadsell.Authorities acting on a tip searched an area Saturday in Isle of Wight County for the young woman. Norfolk police spokesman Sam Shenouda told FoxNews.com the area, which included a retention pond, turned up no clues in the hunt for Hadsell. The pond searched in Carrsville is about 40 miles away from Norfolk.Shenouda said police have recovered items belonging to Hadsell but did not specify what they are or where they were found. At the time of her disappearance, Hadsell was home in coastal Norfolk on Spring Break.The teen sent several unusual text messages to her parents prior to her disappearance, police told WTVR. Her debit and credit cards were later found cut up, according to the station.Hadsell's stepfather, 36-year-old Wesley Hadsell, was arrested last month on charges of obstructing justice, breaking and entering and possession of ammunition by a felon.He is being held without bond and his next court appearance is scheduled for April 29. Norfolk police have not said publicly whether Wesley Hadsell's arrest is connected to his stepdaughter's case.Hadsell's mother reportedly said her husband was following up on a tip when he broke into a home two weeks ago.The teen's grandmother, who is also the mother of Wesley Hadsell, claims her son had nothing to do with her disappearance.\"I don\u2019t condone what he he did, but I know he had nothing to do with it,\" she said.Hadsell is described as 5-foot-6 and weighing 120 pounds, with a mole beneath her bottom lip. Anyone with information on her whereabouts is urged to call the Norfolk Police at (757) 664-7026.FoxNews.com's Cristina Corbin contributed to this report.",

But two men from Canada who took their sons on a journey to the original home of Colonel Harland Sanders say it's a trip they'll never forget.The Times-Tribune reports this was the third trip to the Harland Sanders Cafe and Museum for Brian Lufty. Lufty and one of longtime friends piled their sons into a van for a 34-hour journey to the original home of Kentucky Fried Chicken.Lufty's amusing tales of previous visits to the Kentucky museum and cafe inspired the guys' trip.The friends left Montreal on Thursday, travelling through the U.S. to Col. Sanders' birthplace and burial place before arriving at the Corbin restaurant Saturday afternoon.Though are numerous KFC franchise locations in Quebec, for three of the sons, it was the first time they had tasted KFC.Lufty's son Jesse said it was \"delicious!\"Looks like 2,000 miles is nothing for a genuine bite of classic fried chicken.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",
    "Sign in to comment!By Charles DuelferPresident Barack Obama correctly has pointed out that the impending Iran nuclear deal depends for success upon United Nations inspections.\u00a0 He also said, incorrectly, that \u201c\u2026Iran has also agreed to the most robust and intrusive inspections and transparency regime ever negotiated for any nuclear program in history.\u201dThe President seems not to remember the inspection regime for Iraq following the 1991 Kuwait war.\u00a0 And that inspection regime did not work, for reasons that included both Saddam\u2019s behavior and that of the U.N. Security Council.We learned a great deal about Saddam\u2019s strategy and tactics toward the inspectors following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, because Saddam and his senior aides told us about it.In April 1991, the Security Council linked removal of Iraqi sanctions to Saddam Hussein\u2019s verifiable accounting for all his weapons of mass destruction and acceptance of a monitoring regime to assure, in perpetuity, that he did not recreate these capabilities.Note that the sanctions stayed on until the inspectors reported positively.The Iraq inspectors were given the ability\u2014on paper-- to go anywhere, anytime, with any equipment. They could seize documents, interview people, operate aircraft for transportation (and with sensors), and, basically anything else the Chairman of UNSCOM (the special Iraq WMD inspection team) and the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency decided was necessary.The dynamic was that after the inspectors could verify that Iraq had met the Security Council resolution goals, then Council members would lift \u00a0sanctions.The reality on the ground was quite a different matter.\u00a0 Despite the broad authorities written by the Security Council, inspectors faced delays, deceptions and threats.Inspectors knew they only had as much authority as the Security Council would back up.\u00a0 Saddam knew this as well.Saddam\u2019s top goal was to get out of sanctions.\u00a0 He gave up as little as possible to satisfy the Security Council.\u00a0 And it was the Council, not just the inspectors that he was dealing with.The Security Council consensus may have been strong when the inspections resolution was written, but the will of the Council decayed from that day forward.Iraq\u2019s cooperation with inspections was grudging and sporadic. The process took years. \u00a0Even when Saddam was largely compliant, the inspectors were uncertain about it, even with all the access they had.In the meantime, Russia was pushing Saddam\u2019s case.\u00a0 Moscow worked to put more compliant inspectors on the inspection teams. It constantly challenged the credibility of inspector assessments and helped shift the burden of proof onto the inspectors.It was also clear Moscow aided Iraq in preparing for so-called surprise inspections.Iraq paid well for the help.\u00a0 Among documents published in the Iraq Survey Group\u2019s 2004 report on Iraq\u2019s WMD programs (informally known as the Duelfer Report), was a complete list of oil allocations given by Iraq under the U.N.\u2019s Oil-for-Food Program to a range of beneficiaries. \u00a0Included were many \u00a0senior Russian officials and offices, e.g. the Presidential Office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.According to key Saddam lieutenants these allocations and other direct cash payments produced the desired effects.Saddam also knew some Council members would not agree to military actions against him.This confidence was borne out in December 1998 when UNSCOM reported that after years of effort, it could not complete the tasks given to it by the Security Council under the conditions Iraq permitted.The Council could not agree on a response that would compel Iraqi compliance and President Bill Clinton (with support from Britain) ordered a limited four-day bombing campaign. That was all. Oh, and the inspectors left and Saddam did not let them back in until November 2002 when the build-up to war was clear.So what does all this portend for Iran?\u00a0 Well, one thing implied in the framework agreement made public so far is that the U.N. Security Council will have to re-impose sanctions in response to inspector reports of non-compliance or non-cooperation or anything else.I don\u2019t think anyone believes Security Council members (certainly not Russia) will pre-authorize their vote to impose sanctions on the basis of some assessment by the IAEA.\u00a0 So talk of automatically re-imposing sanctions should be examined very carefully.Nothing Iran has done or said seems to suggest they have given up the desire for a nuclear weapon capability.\u00a0 At best, it may be deferred.\u00a0 They can work the Russians and others over time.\u00a0 They have played a long game so far.Russia --and others\u2014also may have very different incentives in a year or two, or more.This deal may be better than going to war.\u00a0 It\u2019s not clear so far that it\u2019s better than trying to sustain sanctions already in place, vs. re-imposing sanctions later when Iran elects to move further toward nuclear weapons.In any case, it\u2019s clear our ability to shape an outcome has become limited.Charles Duelfer was Deputy Executive Chairman of UNSCOM from 1993 to 2000 and the head of CIA's Iraq Survey Group, which produced the definitive document on Saddam and his WMD programs in 2004.",
    "Sign in to comment!Feb. 20, 2015: A name engraved on the walls of a former chalk quarry, at the Cite Souterraine, Underground City, in Naours, northern France by HA Deanate, 148th Aero Squadron, USA.\u00a0(AP Photo/Jeffrey Gusky)NAOURS, France \u2013 \u00a0A headlamp cuts through the darkness of a rough-hewn passage 100 feet underground to reveal an inscription: \"James Cockburn 8th Durham L.I.\"It's cut so clean it could have been left yesterday. Only the date next to it \u2014 April 1, 1917 \u2014 roots it in the horrors of World War I.The piece of graffiti by a soldier in a British infantry unit is just one of nearly 2,000 century-old inscriptions that have recently come to light in Naours, a two-hour drive north of Paris. Many marked a note for posterity in the face of the doom that trench warfare a few dozen miles away would bring to many.\"It shows how soldiers form a sense of place and an understanding of their role in a harsh and hostile environment,\" said historian Ross Wilson of Chichester University in Britain.Etchings, even scratched bas-reliefs, were left by many soldiers during the war. But those in Naours \"would be one of the highest concentrations of inscriptions on the Western Front\" that stretches from Switzerland to the North Sea, said Wilson.The site's proximity to the Somme battlefields, where more than a million men were killed or wounded, adds to the discovery's importance. \"It provides insight into how they found a sense of meaning in the conflict,\" said Wilson.Naours' underground city is a 2-mile-long complex of tunnels with hundreds of chambers dug out over centuries in the chalky Picardy plateau. During the Middle Ages villagers took shelter there from marauding armies crisscrossing northern France. By the 18th century the quarry's entrance was blocked off and forgotten.In 1887 a local priest rediscovered the site and it eventually became a tourist attraction. That's what likely drew the soldiers to it during the war, said Gilles Prilaux, an archaeologist for France's national archaeology institute. He began a three-year study of the tunnels last July, intending to focus on the site's medieval past \u2014 only to stumble upon this more recent slice of history.\"It was a big surprise,\" Prilaux said of the discovery of the World War I graffiti left by soldiers from Australia, Britain, Canada and the U.S.Soldiers left similar inscriptions in tunnels at Arras and Vimy. But unlike those sites, Naours is well back from the front lines. And it wasn't known to have been used as a shelter or hospital like other Western Front quarries.Photographer Jeff Gusky has tallied 1,821 individual names: 731 Australians, 339 British, 55 Americans, a handful of French and Canadians and 662 others whose nationalities have yet to be traced.\"All these guys wanted to be remembered,\" Gusky says, pointing out examples from Texas and Florida.Naours is only a few miles from Vignacourt, a town used as a staging area for troops moving up to and back from the Somme battlefields some 25 miles to the east. Prilaux thinks that the young soldiers from distant countries would have heard about the famous \"Naours caves\" and taken advantage of a break from war to do some sight-seeing.That idea is backed by an entry in the diary of Wilfred Joseph Allan Allsop, a 23-year-old private from Sydney, Australia. \"At 1 p.m. 10 of us went to the famous Caves near Naours where refugees used to hide in times of Invasion\" Allsop wrote on Jan. 2, 1917.Wilson said the importance of studying graffiti like this has only emerged in the last 10 to 20 years.\"What were previously regarded as incidental acts that occur away from the battlefield have been shown to be highly important in understanding the lives of those who experienced the conflict,\" Wilson said.One of the most moving inscriptions at Naours was made by Herbert John Leach, a 25-year-old from Adelaide. His inscription reads \"HJ Leach. Merely a private. 13/7/16. SA Australia.\"Barely a month after Leach added his name to the wall he was killed in action on Aug. 23, 1916, during the Battle of Pozieres.On his grave, in the Australian cemetery in nearby Flers, his father inscribed \"Duty Nobly Done.\"",

    "Sign in to comment!Sen. Bob Corker on Congress' response to Iran dealThis is a rush transcript from \"Fox News Sunday,\" April 5, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.CHRIS WALLACE, HOST: I'm Chris Wallace.Negotiators reached the outline for a nuclear deal with Iran, but did the U.S. give up too much?(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: This deal is good for the security of the United States, for our allies and for the world.BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: The deal would lift sanctions almost immediately and this at the very time that Iran is stepping up its aggression in terror.WALLACE: We'll have a report on the pros and cons of the deal.And how will Congress respond?We'll ask the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker, in his first television interview since the agreement.Then, religious freedom laws under fire, but who is really being intolerant?Our Sunday group weighs in on the latest debate over religion and gay rights.Plus, this Easter Sunday, the Catholic Church's take on the persecution of Christians and the fight against ISIS.CARDINAL DONALD WUERL, ARCHBISHOP OF WASHINGTON: It's instinctive in us to stay alive, and so everyone has a right to defend their life.WALLACE: The archbishop of Washington, Cardinal Donald Wuerl joins us.And our power players of the week, the stone mason putting the national cathedral back together after the 2011 earthquake.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Welcome to the tippy top of D.C.WALLACE: All, right now, on \"Fox News Sunday.\"(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: And hello again. Happy Easter and happy Passover from Fox News in Washington.After months of intense negotiation, six world powers and Iran have finally reached a framework agreement to curb Tehran's nuclear program. But President Obama must still make a final deal and then convince Congress, Israel and our Sunni allies of its merits.Today, we're going to drill down into the framework. In a few minutes, we'll talk with the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker, who says Congress must approve any agreement.But first, chief Washington correspondent James Rosen with a closer look at the deal -- James.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)JAMES ROSEN, FOX NEWS CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Chris, Iran and U.S. issued separate documents describing what was agreed to is sowing some confusion into what, in fact, was achieved.According to the State Department's fact sheet, Iran will reduce its installed centrifuges from 19,000 to about 6,000, roughly the number Iran had when Barack Obama became president, and other components of Tehran's enrichment infrastructure will be constrained.OBAMA: Iran will no longer enrich uranium at its Fordow facility. Iran will not enrich uranium with its advance centrifuges for at least the next 10 years. The vast majority of Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium will be.JAVAD ZARIF, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: Our facilities will continue. We will continue enriching. We will continue research and development. Our heavy water reactor will be modernized and we will continue the Fordow facility.ROSEN: Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency would enjoy weekly and monthly access to key sites continuous surveillance at others and would have the ability to inspect suspicious sites, but not conduct snap inspections, and Iran would be able to dispute allegations of suspicious activity.MARIE HARF, STATE DEPT. SPOKESPERSON: These elements, as we've said, have -- are the best hedge really against a covert path.GEN. MICHAEL HAYDEN, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: It's not good enough to smother the known facilities with inspectors. You've got to have the ability to go anywhere at any time for that unknown, newly-discovered or suspect facility.ROSEN: Iran's foreign minister accused the U.S. of spinning the terms agreed to, saying in a tweet, \"Iran/5+1 statement, U.S. will cease the application of all nuclear related secondary economic and financial sanctions. Is this gradual?\"The U.S. side maintained that sanction relief will be phased and enacted in tandem with Iranian compliance.JOHN KERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE: If we find at any point that Iran is not complying with this agreement, the sanctions can snap back into place.NETANYAHU: The deal would greatly bolster Iran's economy. It would give Iran thereby tremendous means to propel its aggression in terrorism throughout the Middle East.ROSEN: Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken is hitting the road as we speak, visiting five Mideast states over coming days, starting today in Lebanon, Chris.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: James Rosen reporting from the State Department -- James, thanks for that.Now, let's bring in the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Republican Bob Corker of Tennessee for his first television interview since the agreement.Senator, I know you have been briefed in some detail by top administration officials. What's your -- and I understand it's a framework, but what's your initial reaction to what you've learned?SEN. BOB CORKER, R-TENN., FOREIGN RELATIONS CMTE CHAIRMAN: Chris, I did reach out to the energy secretary and I've had three conversations with him over the last couple of days. I think it would be very difficult for anyone to ascertain at this moment, as you just reported in Iran, they're reporting sort of the mirror image opposite of what's being reported here. And as you saw, Zarif has actually challenged Secretary Kerry for presenting talking points that only intended to cause Congress to be pleased.So, look, there's a lot of water that needs to go under the bridge here. Many, many details are unknown at this point. And so, I don't know how anyone could really ascertain whether this is something good or bad yet for the American citizenry.WALLACE: Now, there are some key issues that both sides agree haven't been settled yet. One of the questions is how fast the sanctions will be lifted. Another one is how quickly Iran could ramp up its centrifuge program after the initial ten years.But let me just ask you -- and I understand that you don't know all the details -- are there any red flags that you see right now? Is there anything at least at this initial point that looks clearly unacceptable to you?CORKER: So, there are four things I would lay out. First of all, as you mentioned, how will the sanctions be relieved? Iran is saying immediate, the U.S. is saying phased. What are the elements that we're going to be looking at to alleviate those?Secondly, and very importantly, the covert activities. What are the snap types of inspections we're going to be able to do? What are the processes that can be in place? Is this going to create some long dispute?Thirdly, you refer to the -- the document refers not even in capital letters to a nuclear development program that Iran has agreed to. It's my understanding that this is actually been written out and yet none of us have been able to see that.And I'll just stop there. Those are three of the red flags. One more I would mention, there's a process through which Iran is going to lay out their previous military dimensions, and yet it doesn't say when that process is going to begin, when it's going to end, is this going to be done by the time there's a final agreement?So, those are some of the red flags. Again, I'm open. I know there are a lot of details that will be worked out over the next several months.That's why on behalf of the American people, Congress needs to be playing a role. What the American people may not know right now, Chris, is there will be all kinds of classified annexes that are very important. They lay out the details as to how much of this is going to take place. And that's why it's so important that Congress play its rightful role in approving this prior to the congressionally mandated sanctions that we put in place are alleviated.WALLACE: Well, let me -- let me get to that right now because your committee, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, will meet on April 14th, that's just nine days from now, to consider legislation that you have already introduced.And let me put up on the screen what that legislation would call for. The president would be prohibited from suspending, not even ending, but even suspending any congressional sanctions for 60 days while the House and Senate review the deal, but President Obama says this --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: If Congress kills this deal, not based on expert analysis, and without offering any reasonable alternative, then it's the United States that will be blamed for the failure of diplomacy. International unity will collapse and the path to conflict will widen.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Senator, couple of questions. Will your committee actually vote on your bill on April 14th? And will you insist on congressional review?CORKER: Absolutely, Chris.Again, I think everyone would say that the congressionally mandated sanctions are what helped in a strong way get Iran to the table. And so, certainly we should approve this deal. We should approve what we see prior to those being lifted.And, look, I've talked to the negotiators. No one, no one has said that Congress weighing in would have any effect on this deal. As a matter of fact, what we know is just quite the contrary. We know that during the negotiations, the fact that Congress was likely to weigh in was something that the administration, the other Western countries were able to use to ensure that this deal isn't worse than it is.So, the fact that they knew Congress was going to weigh in was helpful in the negotiations. Certainly, the American people want to know that someone is teasing out all of the details, especially as they see Iran reporting one thing in their country and the U.S. something else here. So, look, this is the place where sober and thoughtful people to dig in. Look, I want to see a negotiated agreement. I know that a lot of water has to go under the bridge over the next 90 days.And it's very important that Congress is in the middle of this, understanding, teasing out, asking those important questions -- just like the ones that you begun to ask this morning.WALLACE: But, Senator, Foreign Minister Zarif of Iran said yesterday that if there is no deal or if the West backs out, that Iran will be free to continue to resume and to build back its nuclear program. And President Obama says that sanctions, the existing sanctions prior to this negotiation, didn't stop Iran from developing its nuclear program. For instance, 19,000 centrifuge centrifuges.And then, the president said this --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: Do you really think that this verifiable deal, if fully implemented, backed by the world's major powers, is a worse option than the risk of another war in the Middle East?(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: First of all, your reaction to foreign minister's comments about their ability to continue their nuclear program if the West backs out. And secondly, what about the president saying the sanctions don't work and if you kill this deal, we are going to end up with a war?CORKER: So, look, there's always this straw man. As has been said, Chris, we would be better off today with the interim deal, continuing as it is today if we think that we're moving to a bad deal. One of the things that most Americans may not be aware of, but we'd be releasing about $130 billion to the Iranian government once we make this deal over time. Their economy is going to flourish.So, again, I think to pose this straw man of a war, the fact is that Congress has a rightful role to play in this. We know that we've already played a positive role, going through this in detail and making sure that all the answer -- the questions are answered is an appropriate thing for us to do.And that doesn't mean that there won't be a deal. We just set in place a process to insure that if there's a deal, it's a deal that will stand the test of time, that will keep Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.WALLACE: Senator, there are some details I want to go through quickly with you, if I can, sort of housekeeping, if you will.CORKER: OK.WALLACE: One proposal that's been floated is a non-binding vote by Congress. You could disapprove the deal, but then the president could still go ahead and suspend sanctions. Is that acceptable?CORKER: No. No, it's not. I think the bill that we've laid out that has strong bipartisan support, Chairman Menendez, who now stepped down, Chuck Schumer supports this, Tim Kaine, who's been very active, very close to the administration, supports this.There is strong bipartisan support for a binding vote by Congress. This is not something -- look, the president needs to sell this to the American people and Congress needs to be involved in this way.WALLACE: All right. Let me ask you the second question. The White House has said that the president would veto the kind of legislation you're proposing. If he does, you don't need 51 votes or even 60 votes, you need 67 votes, which means 13 Democrats to override his veto.Do you have 67 votes?CORKER: Well, I don't know whether we have 67 votes or not, just with cosponsors and if every Republican supports it, we'll see how that all shapes out. But we've got 64 or 65 that we're aware of today if that were the case.I talked to a number of Democrats over the weekend, and I think there are many more that are considering this.Look, I think the American people want the United States Senate to go through this deal. They understand this is one of the most important geopolitical agreements that will take place during this decade. This is an appropriate place for us to be.If the president feels like this is something that's good for the nation, surely he can sell this to the United States Senate and the House.WALLACE: Finally, sir, I've got about 30 seconds left, the formerly top Democrat on your committee, Senator Bob Menendez, who you mentioned, of New Jersey, has taken a very hard line on a deal and, in fact, cosponsored your mandatory congressional review. He has just been indicted on bribery charges.Do you believe there is any connection between his opposition to the president on this and on Cuba and the fact that he's been brought up on charges?CORKER: Chris, I can't -- I don't know what's going on behind the scenes. I know that Bob Menendez has been a very good partner on foreign policy issues. He's been very constructive. I'm sure that he will continue to be. As to the motivations of Justice Department, I just would have no way of knowing.WALLACE: Senator Corker, we're going to have to leave it there. Thank you so much for coming in and talking to us today. And we'll follow what happens with your legislation, sir.CORKER: Thank you, sir.WALLACE: Up next, our Sunday group joins the conversation about this interim deal with Iran.Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the agreement? Just go to Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday and we may use your question on the air.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: We hope that their leadership takes the right decision, but the deal we'll accept is they end their nuclear program.JAVAD ZARIF, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: None of measures include closing our facilities. The proud people of Iran would never accept that.MARIE HARF, STATE DEPT. SPOKESPERSON: We absolutely made no concessions on your bottom line, and that is the only thing that's important here.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: President Obama setting a tough marker for a nuclear deal with Iran during a 2012 presidential debate, but Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif and State Department spokesperson Marie Harf putting very different spin this week on the framework deal that's actually been agreed to.It's time now for our Sunday group: syndicated columnist, George Will, Mara Liasson from National Public Radio, Jason Riley of The Wall Street Journal, and Fox News political analyst, Juan Williams.Well, as we say, President Obama started out with a firm red line, if you will, that Iran must end its nuclear program, we're obviously a long way from there. George, there are obviously concessions in any negotiation. Did President Obama and the West give up too much or is this a reasonable deal?GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, what was given up that really matters was given up a while ago, that is they conceded the right to enrich, the capacity to enrich and the possession of some low enriched uranium.This deal comes in the fourth quarter of an Obama presidency that has been characterized in foreign policy by four failures: the failure to leave a stable Iraq, the failure of the Russian reset, the failure to advance the Israeli/Palestinian peace process, and the failure to suppress the proliferation of al Qaeda emulators and franchises, if you will.So we went into this with a kind of asymmetry of urgency. The president wanted to stop the Iranian bomb, but he really wanted a deal that could be presented as revolutionary for the whole region. The Iranians wanted to lighten the sanctions, but they really want a nuclear weapon. And I think that's the asymmetry that defines this process.WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel and we got sharply different reactions on Facebook.Bill Farro asked, \"Why would anyone who had Iran struggling because of the embargo take such a weak stance in negotiations?\"But Mary Ann Arlotta writes, \"Kerry did the best he could. There is no way Iran will give up this program.\"Juan, how do you answer Bill and Mary Ann?JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I don't think it's in so much about concessions, especially to Bill's question. I think this really is about commitments. And what we got here is Iran was forced to the bargaining table by the sanctions. And remember, the sanctions, Bill, the sanctions are imposed by an international committee, not the United States alone.So, unless you have the whole group, plus I might add, places like Japan, India, Pakistan, not buying oil from Iran, if that broke down and just U.S. sanctions would not have been sufficient to continue this and Iran would have continued building their nuclear weapons. Right now, I think the estimate it would take three months for them to have breakout capacity, to have nuclear weaponry under this current deal, it looks like it would be about a year. And you have a 15-year time frame in terms of inspections which are unprecedented.So, I think it's -- there were some concessions as you say, but this to me, and I might -- you know, if you're saying, Juan, you tend to be more Democratic than Republican. Take a look at \"The Wall Street Journal\". They're saying it too, this is a useful deal.WALLACE: That is the perfect segue to Jason Riley, because, in fact, I was a little bit surprised \"The Wall Street Journal\" editorial page, which was generally no fan of President Obama, I thought was surprisingly mild in its reaction to the deal, saying that there were useful limits on Iran's nuclear infrastructure but that enforcement and inspections need to be stepped up.So, the question I guess is, Jason, can this deal be saved?JASON RILEY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: I'm skeptical. I'm very skeptical. It is all about the enforcement. Iran has a perfect record of violating every inspection agreement. And I don't think that these snap-back provisions are -- they're easier said than done.WALLACE: Let's put it quickly what the agreement says snap-back, I never heard this before, is their sanctions would be lifted, but if there's any violation then they, quote, \"snap back\".RILEY: Right. But we're farming out the inspections to U.N. officials. Once those sanctions are lifted, you're going to have companies in Asia and Europe going in to cut deals with Iran. And then there will be tremendous pressure to keep those deals in place, snap-back provisions or no snap-back provisions, because there will be an economic interest from those countries to keep that business going.So, once we lift these sanctions, I think it will be very hard to get back to where we are now. I would also add that, you know, neither President Obama, or the Iran foreign minister mentioned that the Fordow facility was built secretly underground, which, of course, is where you build a facility when you have peaceful means in mind for how it will be used.So, I don't think, again, that we can expect Iran to keep up its end of the bargain here. They have no -- we have no reason to believe that they will do so, based on their history.WALLACE: Meanwhile, we -- I want to talk about another foreign policy development this week. We had this horrific attack by terrorists on -- deliberately targeting Christians at a college in Kenya, and meanwhile the civil war in Yemen just continues to spiral out of control.I want to play a clip from President Obama from just a little bit more than six months ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: The strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us while supporting partners on the front lines is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Mara, do White House officials acknowledge that their lighter footprint counterterrorism strategy isn't working?MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Well, yes. I mean, George listed all the foreign policy failures. I can't remember if Yemen was in there or not. But it is certainly one of them. The world looks like it's on fire and ISIS and its imitators are growing, and not necessarily in Kenya but in a lot of places in the Middle East, Iran is part of this conflict and seems to be growing stronger everyday.So, that's a real challenge for the White House. I mean, what is it going to do about this? It's not a matter of root causes, economic -- you know, lack of economic opportunity. More and more this looks like a religious war, going and indiscriminately killing people who are of the other religion. And it's a huge problem.WALLACE: The question I'm asking is that -- I don't mean it as gotcha, but they had a strategy which was the kind of lighter footprint.LIASSON: They adjusted that lighter in Afghanistan. Remember, they were going to pull out faster, more troops. They've agreed to keep about as many troops as their military advisers wanted to.So, I do think there's a kind of adjustment. I don't know what they do in places like Yemen where they're literally falling out and had to pull out their counterterrorism troops. But they are adjusting and the footprint is getting a little less light.WALLACE: George, I was also struck by President Obama's statement this week about the terror attack many Kenya. Let's put this up on the screen. He condemned a terror attack, quote, \"where innocent men and women were brazenly and brutally massacred.\"He never once mentioned the fact that it was Christians who were deliberately targeted.GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Yes. These innocent people were guilty in the eyes of their killers of being Christians, but this is of a piece with the administration's mincing vocabulary as it kind of tiptoes on egg shells to avoid saying there is a religious -- irreducible religious dimension to this conflict. They tried to avoid this but the facts keep rearing their ugly heads.WALLACE: Juan, how do you explain that? On the one hand, your attackers are clearly Islamic radicals, violent Islamic radicals. They don't want to say that. And when it's Christians who are the target, the president doesn't want to say that.WILLIAMS: Well, he should say it, because it's pretty obvious. I don't think there's any getting away from the religious dimension. You look at what ISIS has done when they beheaded those Coptic Christians, if you recall, Chris. And remember now where they have a situation where they had been pushing Christians out of Iraq, you know, kind of ancient homeland of Christianity.I don't think there's any question. Let me say this, these radical violent Muslim extremists also kill Muslims in greater numbers than they kill Christians. So, you have to take that into account. In the case of Kenya, I think it's quite clear, they want to foment a religious war as Mara was saying in Kenya because most of Kenya is Christian.So, they see it a way to destabilize that society, delegitimize the government and create the kind of anarchy that they see.WALLACE: But if it's a religious war, it might help to acknowledge it's a religious war.WILLIAMS: I mean, if you think it will have some kind of strategic value. In the president's mind, not my mind speaking here, but I think in the president's mind, you don't want to say to the Muslim world that this is a war against all of Islam.WALLACE: Well, I don't think we ever would say that.WILLIAMS: Right.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: We haven't ever said that.Jason, let me finish with you. Going back to this question of Iran, there is some talk at the White House perhaps you make a deal with Iran and this begins to open up a new chapter, there's more engagement, there's less isolation. It will change Iran's behavior. The flip side of it is, we're going to be giving them billions of dollars more, as Senator Corker mentioned, which only boosts their economy and their ability to be a bad actor.RILEY: Well, I think one way to look at this in terms of whether we conceded too much is to look at who is chairing the agreement and who is not. Why are our adversaries more excited about this deal than our strategic allies, like France and Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Sunnis and the Arab states, as well as Israel?WALLACE: All right.We have to take a break here. But when we come back, the firestorm of a religious freedom bill in Indiana and Arkansas raises questions over who is really being intolerant. Our Sunday group debates that.Plus, a dismal jobs report has experts wondering how strong is the economic recovery.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. ASA HUTCHINSON, R-ARK.: This is a bill that in ordinary times would not be controversial, but these are not ordinary times.GOV. MIKE PENCE, R-IND.: It's a fix of a bill that through mischaracterization and confusion has come to be greatly misunderstood.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Two Republican governors in full retreat this week over religious freedom bills they supported and then had to rework after protests, the measures would allow discrimination against gays. And we're back now with the panel. Jason, what is your take away from the retreat, if you will, that -- first of all, about the whole debate over religious freedom and the fact that the governors, as you saw here of Arkansas and Indiana after first saying they were going to sign these bills then had to insist that they be reworked before they did -- were finished with them.JASON RILEY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Well, both sides are claiming intolerance here. But I think only one side is really guilty of hypocrisy. And that's what I see going on here. Hillary Clinton who opposed gay marriage until two years ago is tweeting about Indiana's intolerance. The Democratic governor of Connecticut who banned state employees from traveling to Indiana even though Connecticut has essentially the same law in place. So that's what I think is going on here. It is the height of hypocrisy, positions held just a few years ago by Democrats are now considered anti-gay and bigotry in place.WALLACE: Juan, let me pick up on that because the initial push was that these laws and the people who supported them were being intolerant, the idea that a private business could discriminate, let's say, against participants in a gay marriage, that that was intolerant, but you began to hear a push back later, especially this week, that to insist that someone do something that violates their moral conviction, that that's intolerant. How do you balance those two?WILLIAMS: I think it's very hard to balance because, you know, someone who has religious beliefs myself, I want them to be respected. But I do think we're a nation of laws. And we are not a nation of religious beliefs. Everyone in our country can have their religious beliefs, but you have to come back to civil laws and liberties. And as such, I don't think there's any question that if the law specifies that you are open for business, whether it's gays or blacks, that under our laws, public accommodation laws, et cetera, that you have to treat people equally and fairly. That's the basis of our understanding.Now, I will say in response to Jason, there's been a tremendous shift in the terms of American public opinion, and that's why I think you see people who two years ago may have had one position, I think President Obama says he's evolved on this issue, I think much of America has evolved and changed on this issue and that's why you see corporate America taking the lead in this fight, by the way.WALLACE: Jason, let me just pick up on this conversation between the two of you. I think it would certainly agree that if somebody came in to the baker, you know, the proverbial baker's getting a lot of business as baker, that and said, you know, an interracial marriage and we want a cake. I think you would say that that's outrageous the idea that he would not participate in an interracial marriage. Why is that any different than the same sex marriage?RILEY: We have antidiscrimination laws in the book, we have public accommodation laws in the book and there's no indication that there's any pattern of courts allowing these laws, these religious freedom laws to trump those laws. I think this is a straw man. This is being gemmed up. And there's no reason we can't handle them on a case by case basis like we've been doing. But I do agree with Juan that there's an evolution in the country particularly among young people. Which is why you see some division, even on the right about how to proceed with these cultural wars, so to speak. This is very much a generational issue. And with the GOP out there looking at the next presidential election, wanting to appeal to younger voters, there's some indication that, you know, we've got other issues to talk about. Hilary is deleting e-mails. Obama is cutting deals with (INAUDIBLE) over nuclear weapons. Let's talk about those things, those unite the party. They don't want to talk about it.WILLIAMS: And I just quickly say before we let our friends in that, in fact in Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court said that in some cases where you have a family-owned business with strong religious beliefs that you can take into consideration their faith with regard to providing contraception to women. And what we've seen in Indiana is different than Connecticut and these other states, because they would say it's not just a matter of government having to have a high bar in terms of putting any pressure on a religious belief, but individuals and corporations could now go to court and say we're protected by the same kind of provisions.WALLACE: We could continue this conversation and I'm sure we will, but let's turn to the economy and some really disappointing numbers on the economy this week. Here they are. Only 126,000 jobs were added in March. That's the weakest hiring in 15 months. Labor force participation dropped to 62.7 percent, matching the lowest since 1978. And the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta estimates first quarter growth at zero, zero percent, flat. George, what's going on here?GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, for the second year in a row they've blamed poor quarterly growth on insufficient global warming, that is on winter, on an unusually cold winter. Let your mind go back to November last year. There was job creation of 321,000 jobs and the administration said this is a miraculous achievement and a harbinger of things to come. It wasn't a harbinger and it wasn't miraculous. During the Reagan recovery there were 23 months of job creation over 300,000. Reagan had a month of job creation of 1 million and this was at a time when there were 75 million fewer Americans. Now, never mind zero growth. We are now being told really that two percent growth may be the new normal. If so, that's a disaster because every day, today, yesterday, tomorrow, every day between now and 2030, 10,000 more baby boomers become eligible for Social Security and Medicare. If we have two percent growth, the crisis of the welfare state, the crisis of the private sector being able to throw off the revenues, to pay the bills for the promises we've made to ourselves becomes impossible.WALLACE: Just tell again that the labor force participation stat that you have, if it were what it was at the beginning of the Obama administration.WILL: If the workforce participation rate today were as high as it was on the day Barack Obama was inaugurated, the unemployment rate in this country would be 9.7 percent, we wouldn't be complaining about the bad recovery because we wouldn't call it a recovery.WALLACE: All right, let's talk about the bad recovery, Mara. How concerned are they at the White House with those latest jobs numbers? Do they think it's more? Because one of the things I was talking about, was we really had bad weather in the northeast in March and what do they think it says about the recovery?MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Well, I think they are concerned. And it says the recovery can't seem to get any lift off and stay there. I mean, one of the big things that Barack Obama said in the State of the Union address is it's time to turn the page. The recovery is growing. Unemployment is down. Deficit is down. Now it's time to talk about other things. How to get growth more broadly shared, inequality, all sorts of things like that. We don't even have growth now. I think this does shift the big economic debate in the country back to just getting growth. Because you can't talk about it being more widely shared if you don't have it.WALLACE: But you've got to think with the divisions between the Republican Congress and the White House is nothing that they -- the president talks about job stimulus, things like that, nothing he proposes is going to get ...LIASSON: No, absolutely not. Nothing is going to happen ...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is he worse than ...LIASSON: I don't think that they expect that, though. I do think what they were hoping to do was at least lay the table for 2016, get the kind of themes and frame the debate the way he wanted to, not necessarily pass things through Congress, with the exception of a few little things like trade, maybe, maybe some corporate tax reform.WILLIAMS: That's what I was going to say. I think it's even worse than that. Because I think your Congress is talking about sequestration. They cannot pass the kind of infrastructure support the highway trust fund bill. So, essentially Congress is not contributing to this. And I would add that there are lots of people, George, in our society that over time are reaching that baby boomer age you're referring to, and I think that's part of the labor force participation equation.RILEY: I think this president is perfectly happy with this supposed new normal. I mean this is someone who looks at the social welfare states of Europe, with their higher unemployment rates and lower productivity than we have here, and sees them not as cautionary tales, but as models for us to emulate. He wants more entitlements. He is willing to trade for that lower productivity, less labor participation rate for this cradle to grave entitlements and so forth. More social spending. Yeah.WALLACE: You know, Jason, one perhaps good piece of news that comes out of all this is that the Federal Reserve had been kind of shaking the cage talking about that they were about to or shortly going to start lifting short-term interest rates and everybody thinks now that Fed Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen may have to hold off because of this.RILEY: Well, that was always the question with her, whether she would take away the punch bowl when it was time to do so. But to tell you the truth, Chris, if 25 or 50 basis points, it's economy is that fragile that we would be tossed back into recession because of that, we're in much worse shape than the White House is acknowledging.WALLACE: So, anyway not out of the woods yet. Thank you all, panel. See you all next week.When we come back, the Archbishop of Washington Cardinal Donald Wuerl joins the debate over religious freedom. And what do you think? Where is the balance between religious conviction and perfection from discrimination? Let me know on Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday and use the #fns.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Now you can connect with \"Fox News Sunday\" on Facebook and Twitter. Be sure to check out exclusive material online at Facebook and share it with other Fox fans and tweet us at @FoxNewsSunday using #fns. Be part of the discussion and weigh in on the action every \"Fox News Sunday.\"(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: A look at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City on this Easter Sunday. When we invited the Archbishop of Washington, Cardinal Donald Wuerl for a conversation this week, I expected to ask him about the pope's trip to the U.S. this fall and for his Easter message. We did discuss that, but there was also breaking news to cover about the debate over religious freedom laws and that savage terror attack on Christian students in Kenya. Your imminence, Happy Easter and welcome back to \"Fox News Sunday.\"CARDINAL DONALD WUERL, ARCHBISHOP OF WASHINGTON: Chris, thank you. And Happy Easter to you. It's a pleasure to be back.WALLACE: The archdiocese is now involved in your own version of the religious freedom debate, much like what we're seeing in Arkansas and Indiana. The Washington D.C. City Council recently passed a measure that says \"religious institutions can't discriminate in hiring someone who doesn't follow your teachings on birth control and abortion.\" And another measure that says \"religious affiliated schools must treat gay groups like any other.\" How do you balance religious freedom versus gay and reproductive rights?WUERL: I think what we want to do is make sure we're using the same measuring rod for everybody. If we talk about discrimination, then we also have to talk about discriminating against the Catholic Church, its teachings and its ability to carry out its mission. I think at the heart of this is the ability to recognize everyone. Everyone has the dignity of who they are. But how they act now touches others. And no one should be forced to follow the actions of another and accept the actions of another. Our schools should be free to teach. We don't believe in abortion. And we need to be free to teach that.WALLACE: So, let's take the classic case that we're hearing about this week, the Christian baker who is being asked to make a cake for a gay wedding and doesn't want to do it. Is he being intolerant or is it intolerant to demand that he make that cake?WUERL: That's where we have to take a look at the word discrimination. Is it being used in the same way for both instances? I wonder if across the board we're not seeing different measuring rods being used when it comes to issues that we're facing here, for example. Why would it be discrimination for a catholic university to say we're not going to allow a gay rights or an abortion rights group to have their program on our campus? And it not be discrimination for that group to insist that the catholic school change its teaching? If we use the same measure, I think we'll find a way of lowering the decimal level and finding a way to recognize the dignity of everyone and at the same time recognize the freedom and the rights, especially religious liberty of everyone.WALLACE: Let me switch to another very difficult subject this Easter weekend. Christians are being hit across the Middle East and in Africa. In Kenya, the al Shabaab terror group killed 147 targeting Christians. In Libya, ISIS beheaded 21 Egyptian Christians. In Syria, they kidnapped 200 Assyrian Christians.Cardinal, ISIS talks about conquering Rome, their phrase. Is Christianity under attack at this moment?WUERL: I think it's fair to say that. When you look at all of these incidences, I think they're all directed at Christians. What just happened in Kenya, I'm told what I heard on the media was that those assassins went in and they separated the Christians from the Muslims and killed the Christians. This is something that the whole world should be shouting out about, the whole world should be rejecting this.WALLACE: But you know, shouting out and rejecting isn't enough. And I want to ask you about that because Pope Francis says that it is, quote, \"lawful to stop an unjust aggressor. So, what do you do in the case of ISIS? Is it moral to use force? Is it a just war to stop ISIS?WUERL: What the Holy Father said I think is absolutely true. It's also common sense. Everybody knows that you can defend yourself against an aggressor. All you have to do is try even with a child to smack the child. The child's hand is going to go up to protect itself. Why? It's instinctive in us to stay alive. And so everyone has a right to defend their life. What's happening with ISIS, what's happening with this idea of a caliphate, is simply taking intolerance and hatred and violence to a new institutional level. And, yes, everyone has a right to defend themselves. And institutions have a right to defend themselves.WALLACE: On a much happier note, the Holy Father will be visiting the U.S., including here in Washington in September. I know it's early, but do you have a sense of the message that he hopes to bring to this country?WUERL: I think what we're going to hear from him is something we've heard over and over and over again and that is we need to recognize no one is perfect. God loves all of us the way we are. God forgives us. And God asks us to love one another. The great commandment love God and love your neighbor is echoed over and over and over again in the teaching of Pope Francis. But I think what people see and why they're so attracted to him -- and I'm told he has the highest popularity rating of anyone -- I think one of the reasons for that, Chris, is we see in him not just the message, but how you do it. The way in which he lives, treats people, responds to people, says I think to many people says to me, he sounds and looks a lot like what Jesus would have sounded like.WALLACE: There are, on the other hand, some church practices that some American Catholics are not happy with. People who are divorced, unable to take communion, the status of gays in the church, the pope has seemed to try to move the church forward on some of these issues and some top officials in the church have pushed back. Will this pope be able to move the church?WUERL: I think what he's doing is already calling everyone at every level in the church to look at two things. The teaching, which never changes, and how we live that teaching, how we apply that teaching and how we try to make the best of the situation in which we find ourselves. He keeps saying, and this is a beautiful part of his ministry, he keeps saying, go out, meet people where they are, and accompany them on their journey so that perhaps all of us could get a little closer to where we all need to be. And I think that's the beauty of his ministry. I also think that's the secret to why so many people find him so inviting, so welcoming. He's saying you can, you can do better. You don't have to start with being perfect.WALLACE: Finally, your eminence, we would love an Easter message from you to our audience.WUERL: Thank you. As we know, Easter is the great joy of hope, the celebration of the resurrection of Jesus from the dead, but for the whole world, it's a sign of hope. We can do better. We can have a better world. We can build a better community. We, who walk with the risen lord, know that. And the call to everyone else is let's never give up hope, that we can really have a better world.WALLACE: Your eminence, thank you so much. It's always a great joy to have you here. Happy Easter.WUERL: Happy Easter to you as well. Thank you.WALLACE: Please come back.WUERL: All right. I will.WALLACE: Up next, our power player of the week making Washington's National Cathedral whole again.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: It has become the nation's house of prayer, where they held a day of remembrance after 9/11 and the state funeral for Ronald Reagan. And now they are putting it back together. Here is our power player of the week.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)JOE ALONSO, NATIONAL CATHEDRAL HEAD STONE MASON: I started hearing this - what I thought were explosions. I didn't know the whole thing was going to collapse.WALLACE: Joe Alonso is talking about the earthquake that hit Washington in 2011 and the damage it did to the National Cathedral.ALONSO: The energy of that quake traveled up through the masonry walls and then all these slender carved elements, that's what shifted and fell and rotated.WALLACE: As the headstone mason, he leads the team putting the cathedral back together. Two months ago, they finished phase one, repairing the stone and mortar of the ceiling inside. Now comes the hard part.ALONSO: All of these are going to have to be dismantled.WALLACE: A ten year, $22 million project to fix or replace intricately carved stones that weigh tons on top of the cathedral. Alonso took me up the central tower 300 feet.(on camera): Wow. This is a view I've never seen.ALONSO: Welcome to the tippy top of D.C.WALLACE (voice over): It certainly is. An extraordinary vantage point to see the sweep of our nation's capital. But the view of the tower is not so good. The tops of three of the four pentacles fell off, as for what's left ...ALONSO: It's separated. It's the big chunk of stone that joins this to the pinnacle, sheared off back here. Another two or three seconds of earthquake, we would have lost a tremendous amount more stone.WALLACE: One thing that struck us was the remarkable craftsmanship of carvings no visitor will ever see.ALONSO: That's the whole thing. You know, this cathedral, right? Built for God's glory.WALLACE: Found below in the workshop, they're creating new treasures and fixing old ones.ALONSO: We lost three of these finials, they fell off and were destroyed. This was the only one that survived.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Joe Alonso thought he had finished building the cathedral back in 1990. When he helped set the final stone on an 83-year construction project that was Washington's longest.(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)WALLACE: For the next 21 years, he worked on maintenance until the earthquake hit.ALONSO: We all of a sudden got back into construction mode. I mean, construction and big-time restoration.WALLACE (on camera): How do you feel about this cathedral?ALONSO: Oh, it's become a part of me. I mean, so many -- I met my wife here.(LAUGHTER)ALONSO: I literally, I got, you know, blood and sweat, no tears yet. But blood and sweat in between the lime stone.WALLACE (voice over): Which is why making this building whole again means so much to him.ALONSO: And the cathedral is the ultimate place for a stone mason to be in. This cathedral needs to be put back together the way it was. This could be here forever. And knowing that I had a part in it and the generations before. You know this isn't going anywhere.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: Today is the first Easter Sunday since the earthquake without any construction inside. So worshipers will be able to see the full grandeur of the National Cathedral. That's it for today.

    "Sign in to comment!By Howard KurtzKurtz: When activists peddle hateThe Indiana pizza uproar is still giving me indigestion.Just when gay rights advocates had won a victory by getting Mike Pence and the Indiana legislature to modify their religious freedom law, left-wing zealots harassed the poor folks at Memories Pizza into temporarily shutting down.As you probably know, the contretemps began when Crystal O\u2019Connor, one of the shop\u2019s owners, told a local ABC station that they wouldn\u2019t provide pies for a gay wedding. As she later told Neil Cavuto,\u00a0\u201cIt is not a sin that we bring gays into our establishment and to serve them. It is a sin, though, if we cater their wedding. We feel we are participating, we are putting a stamp of approval on their wedding.\u201dBy answering that hypothetical question, O\u2019Connor unleashed an outpouring of hate on social media. Yelp was flooded with such images as Hitler holding a pizza and Jesus holding up a middle finger. \u201cAvoid this place like the Plague,\u201d one person wrote. \u201cSounds to me like a memory of owning a pizza place is all the owners going to have after this idiocy,\u201d said another.Now I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to blame this on \u201cthe left.\u201d It\u2019s not that liberal commentators or leading activists were mounting a crusade against the pizzeria, it\u2019s these morons who spew venom, often anonymously, with nasty tweets, nasty emails, and now nasty restaurant \u201creviews.\u201dI get that Crystal O\u2019Connor\u2019s business may not have a legal right to refuse service, not that there\u2019s a great demand for sausage and pepperoni at gay weddings or any other kind of wedding. But she wasn\u2019t even expressing animosity toward gays and lesbians, just explaining her Christian beliefs.This reinforces my view that the clashes in Indiana and Arkansas were largely about the politics of symbolism. Whether you\u2019re more concerned about religious liberty or about gay rights, how many bakers and florists could have been affected by the Indiana law as originally signed, before a media and business backlash prompted Pence to accept gay rights language in the revised measure?But the larger problem is that too many on the left want to silence free speech or punish those whose beliefs are deemed unacceptable. You see this every time a campus protest forces a conservative speaker to cancel an appearance\u2014and that should depress honest liberals who once fervently fought for free speech.Remember last year, when pressure from gay activists and boycott threats forced Brendan Eich to resign as CEO of the browser company Mozilla? His sin was to make a donation to the 2008 Prop 8 campaign in California, which succeeded at the time in banning gay marriage.Keep in mind that those who don\u2019t support gay marriage are being denounced and hounded for taking the same position that Barack Obama espoused until 2012.Same-sex marriage is now legal in 37 states, and with young people increasingly seeing it as a non-issue, that trend will undoubtedly continue. But it\u2019s important for all of us, in the media and elsewhere, to respect the views of a significant number of Americans who don\u2019t agree.On Crystal O\u2019Connor and the pizza controversy, the Atlantic\u2019s Conor Friedersdorf, a gay marriage supporter, frames the question around small-business owners as \u201cshould we destroy their livelihoods\u201d:\u201cThe owners of Memories Pizza are, I think, mistaken in what their Christian faith demands of them. And I believe their position on gay marriage to be wrongheaded. But I also believe that the position\u00a0I'll gladly serve any gay customers but I feel my faith compels me to refrain from catering a gay wedding\u00a0is less hateful or intolerant than\u00a0let's go burn that family's business to the ground.\u201cAnd I believe that the subset of the gay-rights movement intent on destroying their business and livelihood has done more harm than good here\u2014that they've shifted their focus from championing historic advances for justice to perpetrating small injustices against marginal folks on the other side of the culture war.\u201dBut liberal Washington Post columnist Gene Robinson likens the debate to the civil rights movement:\u201cIt is her right to believe whatever she wants. Religious liberty is guaranteed by the Constitution. But in a pluralistic society, freedom of worship cannot mean a business that serves the general public can discriminate. When I was growing up in the South, there were business owners who believed the Lord didn\u2019t intend for different races to mix, much less marry. Federal civil rights legislation barred these businesses from acting on that belief. The proprietors got over it.\u201dBut National Review\u2019s Jonah Goldberg says that critics of these religious freedom laws are going overboard:\u201cComparing RFRA laws to Jim Crow laws turns all of this on its head. Jim Crow laws forced tolerant businesses to be intolerant of blacks. No one, anywhere, is suggesting that people who want to do business with same-sex couples should be barred from doing so. The argument is whether the government should force a few ardent Christians (or Jews or Muslims) to participate in a ceremony that violates their faith.\u201dRush Limbaugh is escalating matters further, saying the battle is part of \u201cthe Democrats\u2019 war on Christianity\u201d because \u201cthey resent that Christianity provides a repository for faith and confidence in something other than government, which is where they want all power localized.\u201dI get that passions are running high. But if Republicans and Democrats were able to find a compromise in Indianapolis, perhaps we could all lower the temperature a bit\u2014and that includes those who think it\u2019s great sport to harass a small pizza shop owner.Click for more from Media Buzz45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

    "Sign in to comment!Feb. 20, 2015: A name engraved on the walls of a former chalk quarry, at the Cite Souterraine, Underground City, in Naours, northern France by HA Deanate, 148th Aero Squadron, USA.\u00a0(AP Photo/Jeffrey Gusky)NAOURS, France \u2013 \u00a0A headlamp cuts through the darkness of a rough-hewn passage 100 feet underground to reveal an inscription: \"James Cockburn 8th Durham L.I.\"It's cut so clean it could have been left yesterday. Only the date next to it \u2014 April 1, 1917 \u2014 roots it in the horrors of World War I.The piece of graffiti by a soldier in a British infantry unit is just one of nearly 2,000 century-old inscriptions that have recently come to light in Naours, a two-hour drive north of Paris. Many marked a note for posterity in the face of the doom that trench warfare a few dozen miles away would bring to many.\"It shows how soldiers form a sense of place and an understanding of their role in a harsh and hostile environment,\" said historian Ross Wilson of Chichester University in Britain.Etchings, even scratched bas-reliefs, were left by many soldiers during the war. But those in Naours \"would be one of the highest concentrations of inscriptions on the Western Front\" that stretches from Switzerland to the North Sea, said Wilson.The site's proximity to the Somme battlefields, where more than a million men were killed or wounded, adds to the discovery's importance. \"It provides insight into how they found a sense of meaning in the conflict,\" said Wilson.Naours' underground city is a 2-mile-long complex of tunnels with hundreds of chambers dug out over centuries in the chalky Picardy plateau. During the Middle Ages villagers took shelter there from marauding armies crisscrossing northern France. By the 18th century the quarry's entrance was blocked off and forgotten.In 1887 a local priest rediscovered the site and it eventually became a tourist attraction. That's what likely drew the soldiers to it during the war, said Gilles Prilaux, an archaeologist for France's national archaeology institute. He began a three-year study of the tunnels last July, intending to focus on the site's medieval past \u2014 only to stumble upon this more recent slice of history.\"It was a big surprise,\" Prilaux said of the discovery of the World War I graffiti left by soldiers from Australia, Britain, Canada and the U.S.Soldiers left similar inscriptions in tunnels at Arras and Vimy. But unlike those sites, Naours is well back from the front lines. And it wasn't known to have been used as a shelter or hospital like other Western Front quarries.Photographer Jeff Gusky has tallied 1,821 individual names: 731 Australians, 339 British, 55 Americans, a handful of French and Canadians and 662 others whose nationalities have yet to be traced.\"All these guys wanted to be remembered,\" Gusky says, pointing out examples from Texas and Florida.Naours is only a few miles from Vignacourt, a town used as a staging area for troops moving up to and back from the Somme battlefields some 25 miles to the east. Prilaux thinks that the young soldiers from distant countries would have heard about the famous \"Naours caves\" and taken advantage of a break from war to do some sight-seeing.That idea is backed by an entry in the diary of Wilfred Joseph Allan Allsop, a 23-year-old private from Sydney, Australia. \"At 1 p.m. 10 of us went to the famous Caves near Naours where refugees used to hide in times of Invasion\" Allsop wrote on Jan. 2, 1917.Wilson said the importance of studying graffiti like this has only emerged in the last 10 to 20 years.\"What were previously regarded as incidental acts that occur away from the battlefield have been shown to be highly important in understanding the lives of those who experienced the conflict,\" Wilson said.One of the most moving inscriptions at Naours was made by Herbert John Leach, a 25-year-old from Adelaide. His inscription reads \"HJ Leach. Merely a private. 13/7/16. SA Australia.\"Barely a month after Leach added his name to the wall he was killed in action on Aug. 23, 1916, during the Battle of Pozieres.On his grave, in the Australian cemetery in nearby Flers, his father inscribed \"Duty Nobly Done.\"",
    "Sign in to comment!U.S. Border Patrol agents in Texas say they are seeing an increasing amount of illegal immigrants hide inside air flow vents of trucks to try to get past checkpoints undetected.Last week, there were five incidents in which agents at the Falfurrias checkpoint found people stashed away in the small compartments of big rigs, KGBT reported Saturday.\"I believe Tuesday (March) 31st, we had a group of seven immigrants which is quite a few illegal immigrants to be hiding in the back of some of these air dams,\u201d said Omar Zamora, the spokesperson for Border Patrol\u2019s Rio Grande Valley sector.Zamora said cases are becoming more common and he believes the immigrants camp out at local truck stops waiting for unsuspecting drivers.\"In many cases (truck drivers) may not know anything about it, but what they can do and what we\u2019re asking them to do is check. It will only take a couple minutes,\" he said.Drivers will get cited whether or not they are aware if people are hiding in their truck, KGBT reports.Click for more from KGBT.",
    "Sign in to comment!Obama calls Iran nuke deal 'once in a lifetime opportunity'The Obama administration mounted a new argument Monday for why skeptical lawmakers and U.S. allies should back the preliminary nuclear agreement with Iran, calling it a \u201cforever agreement\u201d that would block all pathways to a nuclear weapon and set up tough international inspections with no end date.Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, in a rare appearance at the White House press briefing, used that term in defending the deal he helped strike in Switzerland.\u201cI want to say this is not an agreement for 10 years or 15 years or 20 years. It is a long-term agreement with a whole set of phases,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if Iran earns over this time period trust and confidence in their peaceful objectives, well then over time the constraints will, in phases, ease up, but never get lower than the additional protocol and all of the access that it provides.\u201cSo that's the way we\u2019re thinking about it. It's not a fixed-year agreement. It's a forever agreement in a certain sense, with different stages.\u201dYet, as Moniz acknowledged, the fact-sheet circulated by the White House last week includes a series of expiration dates for key components of the deal.This includes:Asked Monday how this could be considered \u201cforever,\u201d White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said they were referring to how Iran would have to submit to a new set of intrusive nuclear inspections, as part of provisions that have \u201cno end date.\u201dMoniz likewise pointed to these comprehensive inspections \u2013 part of what he called \u201cunprecedented\u201d access and transparency -- in calling this a \u201cforever agreement.\u201d (Some of those inspection requirements still have end-dates on them, though much further out than 10 or 15 years.)Moniz, a nuclear physicist, spoke at the White House as the Obama administration ramped up its campaign for a framework deal with Iran that has drawn criticism from congressional Republicans, the Israeli government and skeptical Arab allies of the U.S.Under the agreement, Moniz said, all plutonium created as a byproduct of Iran's nuclear power production would be sent out of the country so it couldn't be used to make weapons. And international inspectors would watch over all stages to ensure Tehran sticks to the agreement. \"This is not built upon trust, this is built upon hard-nosed requirements,\" Moniz said.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been among the most vocal critics in airing concerns about how certain terms of the deal last for just 10 years.For the near term, though, the Obama administration is perhaps most concerned about selling this deal to Congress, where lawmakers are set to soon consider bipartisan legislation giving Congress a say on any Iran deal.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Monday reiterated some of his concerns with the deal, citing the timeline spelled out in the framework unveiled last week.\u201cThe parameters of the interim deal, in essence, establish an internationally recognized, 10-year nuclear research and development program. Until we know more about Iran's previous research, no nation can be sure of what Iran may have developed covertly already,\u201d he said in a statement. McConnell vowed that the Senate would \u201crespond legislatively\u201d with the congressional review bill, which is set for a committee vote next week.House Speaker John Boehner, meanwhile, linked from his Twitter page to a first-hand account of his call last week with Obama on the agreement.\u201cIt would be na\u00efve to suggest the Iranian regime will not continue to use its nuclear program, and any economic relief, to further destabilize the region,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cIn the weeks ahead, Republicans and Democrats in Congress will continue to press this administration on the details of these parameters and the tough questions that remain unanswered. We will stand strong on behalf of the American people and everyone in the Middle East who values freedom, security, and peace.\u201dObama continues to staunchly defend the framework agreement worked out with other world powers as a \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\" to prevent an Iranian bomb and bring longer-term stability to the Middle East. He insists the U.S. would stand by Israel if it were to come under attack, but acknowledged that his pursuit of diplomacy with Tehran has caused strain with the close ally.\"It's been a hard period,\" Obama said in an interview with New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman. He added that it is \"personally difficult\" for him to hear his administration accused of not looking out for Israel's interests.The framework reached with Iran last week clears the way for negotiators to hammer out technical details ahead of a June 30 deadline for a final deal.He reiterated his opposition to the legislation that would give the U.S. Congress final say in approving or rejecting a deal, but said he hoped to find a path to allow Congress to \"express itself.\"Earnest on Monday urged Congress to at least wait until June to pass judgment on the plan, while still opposing\u00a0any up-or-down vote in Congress.The Associated Press contributed to this report.45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

He peered silently into the glass-enclosed case at the rocking chair, then snapped pictures for posterity.\"You just get drawn into these things,\" said Buczkiewicz, 47, who came from suburban Chicago with his family to the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. \"It is a tragic part of our history and our country. I think it's important to take it all in.\"March 23, 2015: The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich. is offering a closer glimpse of the pivotal piece of history to mark the assassination\u2019s 150th anniversary.\u00a0(The Associated Press)Taking in objects from the final hours of two important American lives is a major draw to the museum. In addition to the worn, red chair Lincoln was sitting in when he was shot in Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., in 1865, the Henry Ford also owns the limousine President John F. Kennedy was riding in when he was fatally shot in Dallas nearly a century later. Museum officials say the chair and car are among the most visited artifacts in the museum, along with the bus Rosa Parks rode in when she refused to give up her seat to a white rider and helped spark the civil rights movement.The chair in which President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated on April 14, 1865 is shown on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich., March 23, 2015. The Henry Ford Museum is offering a closer glimpse of the pivotal piece of history to mark the assassination\u2019s 150th anniversary. The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn will remove the chair from its glass enclosure on April 15, the sesquicentennial of Lincoln\u2019s death. It will be displayed in a plaza area and museum admission will be free. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya)\u00a0(The Associated Press)Next week, visitors will get an even closer look at the Lincoln chair: It will be removed from its enclosure and displayed in an open plaza area as part of the museum's observance of the assassination's sesquicentennial on April 15 \u2014 a day of free admission. Two days earlier, it will be onstage when renowned historian and Lincoln expert Doris Kearns Goodwin delivers a sold-out lecture at The Henry Ford.Goodwin, author of \"Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,\" told The Associated Press that the chair will offer an extra \"dimension\" to her words and the experience of those in the room.\"There's an intimacy to it that catapults you back in time,\" she said. \"And hopefully, along with that, you're not just thinking of the death but the life that made it worthwhile.\"March 23, 2015: The bus Rosa Parks rode in when she refused to give up her seat to a white rider and helped spark the civil rights movement is shown on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich.\u00a0(The Associated Press)Lincoln's chair has been part of the museum started by pioneering automaker Henry Ford \u2014 no relation to the theater-owning Ford family \u2014 since its founding 85 years ago. The government removed it from the theater and held it as evidence, and it ended up at the Smithsonian Institution. The wife of a theater co-owner petitioned to reclaim it, then sold it at auction to an agent working for Henry Ford.Henry Ford also bought the Logan County Courthouse where Lincoln practiced law in Illinois in the 1840s and moved it to the outdoor area next to his museum known as Greenfield Village. For decades, the theater chair was housed in that courthouse.Around 1980, the chair was placed inside the museum, where it's now part of the \"With Liberty and Justice for All\" exhibit.\"Lincoln was one of Henry Ford's heroes \u2014 when he decided he wanted to have this village, he wanted to collect Lincoln stuff as an educational tool,\" said curator Donna Braden. \"The courthouse is pretty much the first thing Henry Ford acquired related to Lincoln and the chair came soon after.\"March 23, 2015: A playbill from \"Our American Cousin\" from the night President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated on April 14, 1865 is shown on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich.\u00a0(The Associated Press)Many visitors wonder whether dark spots on the back of the chair are Lincoln's blood. Not so, say museum workers: The stains are oil from other people's heads who sat in the chair before that fateful night when Lincoln was shot by a pro-Confederacy actor, John Wilkes Booth.Steve Harris, a historic presenter at the museum, tells passers-by that Lincoln's head would have been positioned much higher than the stain because he was 6 feet 4 inches tall (1.93 meters).Milestone anniversaries seem to add to the impact of objects like the chair and limo. About 8,000 people visited the limo on Nov. 22, 2013, a free-admission day marking the 50th anniversary of JFK's assassination, so the chair is likely to draw plenty of visitors on the Lincoln anniversary.\"It really is about the power of the artifact,\" said Patricia Mooradian, president of The Henry Ford, as the entire history attraction is known. \"It's less about the artifact itself than the symbolic nature of the artifact that represents a great paradigm change in the history of our country.\"Buskiewicz has also visited Dealey Plaza in Dallas where Kennedy was assassinated. \"You just have to try to take it in when you're in those areas,\" he said, but he wonders \"why we gravitate\" toward places and things associated with these types of events.Goodwin, whose book helped inspire Steven Spielberg's movie, \"Lincoln,\" says that standing before iconic yet everyday objects provides a deep experience that transcends the moment that made them famous.\"In some ways, it's more familiar when it's a chair, a bus or a limo,\" she said. \"There's something about the tangibility of these things.\"___If You Go...HENRY FORD MUSEUM: 20900 Oakwood Boulevard, Dearborn, Michigan; http://www.thehenryford.org/ or 800-835-5237.

    "By Todd Starnes, Fox NationRolling Stone has officially retracted a story about an alleged gang rape at a University of Virginia fraternity house.

Miss Erdely penned an apology \u2013 sort of an \u201coopsie, my bad\u201d - but failed to mention the men of Phi Kappa Psi. The fraternity's good name has been smeared, their reputations ruined by and act of journalistic malpractice.This is standard operating procedure for the mainstream media. It doesn't matter if the gang rape was fabricated; what's important is it sparked a national conversation.

    "Sign in to comment!By Catherine HerridgeSchiff says Al Qaeda having 'resurgence' amid Yemen chaosAl Qaeda's Yemen affiliate is expanding its footprint amid the chaos in the country and now providing guidance to the Somalia terror group that claimed responsibility for last week's deadly terror attack at a university, an intelligence source told Fox News.The warning underscores the growing threat posed by Al Qaeda in Yemen at a time when the advance of Shiite rebels has effectively created a power vacuum in the country, with the unrest stalling what had been a robust U.S. counterterrorism operation there.The intelligence source told Fox News that the affiliate is providing guidance to Somalia's al-Shabaab on how major plots -- like the attack at Garissa University College in Kenya that killed nearly 150 people -- can support their regional ambitions.The intelligence source said Al Qaeda in Yemen is providing guidance and fighters, and sharing bomb-making techniques that account for the more sophisticated vehicle-borne explosive devices now being recovered in the region.In mid-March, for instance, FBI investigators found a Toyota Hilux with IEDs welded to the floor and back-seat of a vehicle that had been tracked by the FBI from Somalia to Kenya.Al Qaeda's affiliate also got a boost last week by taking advantage of the fall of Mukalla -- the capital of Yemen's largest province, Hadramawt. Militants freed about 300 inmates from the city's main prison. About one-third of the prisoners released are militants with Al Qaeda in Yemen, and one of the group's top regional commanders, Khaled Batarfi, was among them.A 2006 prison break had originally laid the foundation for the establishment of the group's leadership.Meanwhile, the influence of AQAP is not lost even on President Obama's own party.California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff said Sunday that Al Qaeda is having a \"resurgence.\"\"In Yemen the news is really all bad,\" Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, told ABC's \"This Week.\" \"Just as we feared in the chaos ... Al Qaeda has had a resurgence.\"\"It's absolutely a safe haven,\" Michael Leiter, former director of the National Counterterrorism Center, also told ABC.He said the administration's policy is correct, though, compared to the alternative of a massive American occupation.\"That doesn't mean that the administration's strategy is flawless, however,\" he said. \"And I think had we put greater emphasis and resources in trying to deal with the governance issues in Yemen, this might have been prevented.\"At least 500 people have been killed in the fighting as Shiite rebels known as Houthis continue to try to overthrow the Yemen government and as neighboring Saudi Arabia leads an airstrike campaign to stop the rebels.The administration has referred to its efforts in Yemen as a \"success story\" and just several days ago continued to defend its strategy.White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told MSNBC that U.S. policy \"should not be graded against the success or the stability of the Yemeni government.\"He also said the strategy has been to try to bolster the government in Yemen, which has for years been in a chaotic state and the administration's objective \"has never been to try to build a Jeffersonian democracy.\"\"The goal is to make sure Yemen cannot be a safe haven that extremists can use to attack the West and to attack the United States,\" he said.Late last month, the administration removed U.S. personnel from the Arab country, as the situation deteriorated.Obama has said several times in recent years that Al Qaeda has been \"decimated\" or is \"on the run.\"The Associated Press contributed to this report.Catherine Herridge is an award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington, D.C.

Mark Wysocky with the Florida Highway Patrol says the 2006 Ford Expedition was traveling on central Florida's Atlantic Coast in Martin County when a left rear tired separated. The driver, Oduver Miranda, 25, lost control of the SUV, carrying seven children, traveled onto the shoulder and overturned. Troopers say all 12 occupants were relatives from Apopka and a police report indicated half of them were not wearing seat belts.Authorities say 38-year-old Uriel Miranda died at the scene and his 2-year-old daughter, Yaretsi Miranda, died Saturday evening at Tradition Medical Center. Eight-year-old Yordi Miranda died Sunday at Saint Mary\u2019s Medical Center. Authorities said the former two were among those not wearing seatbelts.The other nine were transported to different hospitals with injuries ranging from minor to critical. As of Sunday afternoon, they were listed in stable or critical-but-stable condition and two had already been released from the hospital.According to News 13, neighbors say the family had traveled to South Florida to get passports from the Guatemalan consulate and was returning to Apopka at the time of the crash.Wysocky said the SUV had a capacity of nine occupants, and the cause of the crash remains under investigation.The Associated Press contributed to this report",

Diff., a bug that irritates the intestines, cause dreadful cases of diarrhea when, for example, unwittingly transferred from one sick patient, to a doctor\u2019s hands, and then to another patient.While washing or sanitizing one\u2019s hands before and after each patient encounter is common practice in clinics and hospitals, it\u2019s no longer enough to kill these persistent microbes. So hospitals are increasing the number of times they require doctors and nurses to wash their hands, and have developed fancy new mathematical formulas, algorithms, and new sanitation devices to track cleanliness and decrease the dangers for patients during their hospital stays.What\u2019s more, microbial resistant materials such as Noble Biomaterials' X-STATIC are coming online. These materials are used for hospital scrubs and lab coats, as well as patient privacy curtains. X-STATIC can reduce bacteria on the surface of fabrics in the healthcare environment, according to a spokesman for Noble Biomaterials.According to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one in 25 hospital patients comes down with an infection picked up while being treated. In 2011, an estimated 722,000 patients were infected during their hospital stay, and about than 75,000 died from healthcare-related infections. That\u2019s more than 200 deaths per day.Low Ebola risk\u201cWhile the risk of someone contracting the Ebola virus in the U.S. is quite low, the risk is much higher that they'll suffer an infection from one of the superbugs (resistant to antibiotics) that are prevalent in our hospitals right now,\u201d says Melinda Hart, a marketing manager of Xenex, maker of a germ-zapping robot called Eden which uses ultraviolet light to kill nasty microbes on the likes of countertops and other surfaces. Eden is in use at 250 hospitals across the U.S., including major academic medical centers like Northwestern Memorial Hospital, in downtown Chicago. \u201cAmericans are in much greater danger from germs that already exist in our hospitals than they are from Ebola,\u201d added Hart.The anti-microbial technologies are being deployed not just in emergency rooms, but in intensive care units and even public waiting areas, killing MRSA, Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureaus, and other dangerous superbugs, experts told FoxNews.com.Tracking toolsIgnaz Semmelweis, an obstetrician working at Vienna General Hospital in the 19th century, first observed that by washing his hands with bleach before he touched his patients, he could reduce their mortality rate by 90 percent.Doctors and nurses typically use the \u201cin and out method,\u201d cleaning their hands only upon entry and exit of a patient\u2019s room, despite the fact that they can touch multiple bacteria-laden surfaces during the encounter. Compliance with hand washing protocols is usually on the honor system, though some hospitals have had an aide follow doctors and check on the list on a clipboard the number of times they wash per visit.Dr. John Jernigan, a CDC epidemiologist, said at a recent conference that physicians and nurses wash their hands probably only 50 percent of the time, and this has \u201cbeen a very chronic and difficult problem to get adherence levels up as high as we would want them.\"There are now high-tech ways monitor and report hand hygiene events to improve compliance and lower infection spread. One of these is the DebMed Group Monitoring System. The system uses an evidence-based algorithm to pre-determine the expected number of times hospital staff should have washed and/or sanitized their hands - hand hygiene opportunities. The DebMed Group Monitoring System calculates a compliance rate for each specific unit in real-time by dividing the actual hand hygiene events, or the numerator, by the expected number of opportunities for hand hygiene, or the denominator.Another monitoring technology is being used by SSM St. Mary's Health Center in Richmond Heights, Mo., near St. Louis. The hospital has been a test site for a system developed by Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Biovigil. A flashing light on a badge turns green when a clinician\u2019s hands are clean, red if they're not. The technology tracks each hand-cleaning opportunity \u2014 and records the successes and the flops. Hospital officials say compliance is up to 97 percent now, and they are shooting for 100 percent in the future.Wireless technology is in the mix, too. The maker of Purell hand sanitizer, Akron, Ohio-based GOJO Industries, has created an electronic compliance monitoring system using wireless technology to track when hand sanitizer dispensers are used. The SmartLink system gives data on high-and low-compliance areas of each hospital where it is deployed.However, there\u2019s one caveat for the sanitization technologies - a paper in a medical journal recently noted that there\u2019s not a lot of data about whether the detection devices themselves contain bugs. So further investigation is needed, experts told FoxNews.com.",

    "Sign in to comment!ISTANBUL \u2013 \u00a0Turkey on Monday blocked access to social networking sites, including Twitter and YouTube, over photos showing a militant pointing a gun at a prosecutor who died last week in a failed hostage rescue operation. Access to Twitter was restored several hours later.A spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said a Turkish prosecutor had ordered Internet providers to block the sites. The request stemmed from postings of photos that showed militant Marxists pointing a gun at the prosecutor, Mehmet Selim Kiraz, who died in a shootout between police and the Marxists who were holding him hostage.Government officials have blasted Turkish media for posting the images, which they have called anti-government propaganda. Kiraz, was shot in the head during the standoff and died in a hospital soon after.The state-run Anadolu Agency said access was blocked because Twitter and YouTube didn't remove images of the prosecutor despite an official notification. It said the Internet Providers notified Twitter and YouTube, but video, photographs and audio continued to be posted on these sites. The Turkish telecommunications authority wouldn't immediately comment.A government official said Turkey decided to lift the ban on Twitter in the late afternoon after the company agreed to remove all images of the prosecutor and telecoms authorities verified that it had done so. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue.Twitter said earlier that it was working to restore access to users in Turkey.\"We are aware of reports of interruption of our service in Turkey, and we are working to restore access for our users as soon as possible,\" the company said in Turkish and in English through its (at)policy account.The journalists group, Turkish Press Council, said that while it understood the authorities concerns over the publication of the prosecutors' photographs, it said banning social media websites was in conflict with democracy.\"It is meaningless to totally shut down social platforms -- which contain billions of useful information -- to the use of the Turkish people because of some unsuitable content,\" the group said.Users meanwhile were sharing information on how to get around the ban on the Internet.Last year, Turkey blocked access to YouTube and Twitter after audio recordings of a secret security meeting or tapes suggesting corruption by government officials were leaked on the social media sites. Turkey's highest court, however, overturned the bans, deeming them to be unconstitutional.Previous moves by Turkish authorities to block the social media networks have provoked widespread criticism by Western governments and human rights organizations.Many tech-savvy users, including former President Abdullah Gul, had found ways to circumvent the bans both on Twitter and YouTube while they were in place.",

Each guess costs a $2.50 ticket.The most recent ice thickness measured about 35 inches, the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner newspaper (http://is.gd/JHuWqt) reported.Each year, a clock is connected by cable to a wooden tripod anchored in the river ice about 300 feet from shore. When the ice breaks up and the tripod falls or moves, the cable tightens and stops the clock.Cherrie Forness, manager of the Ice Classic, urged people not to wait until the deadline, which falls on Easter this year. \"People are going to be running out, so don't wait until the last day,\" Forness said.Ice Classic organizers last year ran out of tickets even though 300,000 were printed. Records were set for ticket sales and the size of the winning pot. Organizers this year printed 340,000 tickets.The ice went out last year at 3:48 p.m. April 25. The record winning pot totaled $363,627 and was split among 25 tickets.For this time of year, the 35 inch measurement is thinner than average. But it is close to the measurement of 36 inches on March 31 of last year.The ice is not showing signs of weakness yet, Forness said.\"There has not been any water that we can see, of course,\" she said. \"It's still solid from bank to bank, so it's still going to be a little bit.\"___Information from: Fairbanks (Alaska) Daily News-Miner, http://www.newsminer.com",

There was no immediate word on the fate of two men abducted at the same time.The military said the rescue of Sjaak Rijke took place at 5 a.m. Monday in far northern Mali, and that several militants were captured. Monday's statement did not identify who was holding Rijke, but the Dutchman appeared in a video posted in November by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.Some 3,000 French forces are taking part in the mission to stabilize Mali, which was overrun by Al Qaeda-linked Islamic extremists until French troops came to the aid of Malian soldiers in January 2013.Rijke was abducted by extremists in November 2011 from a hostel in Timbuktu along with Swede Johan Gustafsson and South African Stephen Malcolm, who holds dual British citizenship. A German died in the attack. Officials in France and the Netherlands did not say whether there was anty news of Gustafsson or Malcolm.France said Rijke was safely evacuated to a French operating base in Tassalit.Hostage-taking has proved to be a lucrative business in Mali, other Sahel countries and further afield in the war zone of Syria and Iraq.Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said Rijke is being cared for by Dutch embassy staff and troops in Mali, and is doing well under the circumstances.\"This is fantastic news for Sjaak and his family.

    "DuPont Co. said Monday that activist investment firm Trian Fund Management LP's proposal to break up the chemical company would cost $4 billion, add continuing expenses and diminish its research capabilities.The estimate came as DuPont again resisted Trian's effort to replace four DuPont directors, calling the investment firm's campaign \"value destructive.\"Trian has been pushing for months to shake up the 212-year-old chemical and agriculture conglomerate, calling for greater accountability by DuPont's board and proposing to split DuPont into one company focused on agriculture and nutrition and another focused on industrial materials. Such a move would streamline DuPont's businesses and help them better compete against rivals, according to Trian.DuPont estimated in an investor presentation on Monday that separating the businesses would cost $4 billion, including expenses related to forming the two new companies, shifting debt, and tax changes. The added costs of doubling administrative and legal functions for two companies and tax-related expenses also would add $1 billion in annual expenses, DuPont said.Separating the companies also would eliminate DuPont's ability to develop new products using scientific research that spans its various divisions, the company said.Trian, led by Chief Executive Nelson Peltz, has argued that splitting the company would help eliminate $2 billion to $4 billion in annual costs.A spokeswoman for Trian declined to comment on DuPont's breakup-cost estimates.\"DuPont is attempting to distract and mislead shareholders from the real issues at the company,\" she said. \"If a Trian principal and our other nominees are elected to the company's board, we will work constructively to help eliminate excessive corporate costs, bureaucracy and management rhetoric, and bring the highest level of accountability to the boardroom.\"After DuPont spurned its earlier proposals, Trian in January nominated four director candidates to DuPont's board, including Mr. Peltz. In February, DuPont named two new directors in a board overhaul that excluded Trian nominees.DuPont said in March that it was willing to add to its board one of Trian's nominees, former GE Asset Management Chief Executive John Myers, as part of what the company called a \"constructive resolution\" to the proxy fight.On Monday, however, the Wilmington, Del., company said \"none of Trian's nominees add value or skills needed to advance DuPont's strategy.\"The company said Trian's candidates, including Mr. Peltz, lack experience in the chemicals industry.Trian declined to comment.Shares in DuPont advanced 61 cents to close at $72 each on the New York Stock Exchange.

(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)\u00a0(The Associated Press)AUGUSTA, Ga. \u2013 \u00a0We're suckers for athletes who play with a lot of heart. In Erik Compton's case, make that plural: hearts.He'll tee off this week at the Masters on his third.The 35-year-old veteran would rather be known for his golf than what he's had to overcome to earn a spot in the field. But Compton isn't shy about sharing his story, either.A first heart transplant at 12, then a second in 2008 after a major heart attack \u2014 what doctors call a \"widow-maker\" \u2014 while driving home from a lesson with longtime coach and close pal Charlie DeLucca. He's been trying make up for lost time ever since.\"It's hard, but it's also a great thing,\" Compton said Monday after a practice round at Augusta National. \"There's two sides to me. I'm a competitor and a sports person, and I'm also the recipient of two transplants, and I know what that involves. So when you put them together, it does make a little bit of spaghetti in my mind sometimes you know,\" he added a moment later, \"I'll take it.\"It's not like Compton had a choice. He recovered from his childhood setback to become the No. 1-ranked junior in the United States at 18, then a two-time All-American at Georgia. But he's spent most of the intervening years battling on minor league circuits, then becoming an advocate and spokesman for Donate Life, an alliance for national and local groups raising awareness about organ and tissue donation.In a nice bit of serendipity, his first appearance in the Masters coincides with Donate Life Month. But it's already a full-time campaign for Compton \u2014 he's been displaying the organization's logo on his shirt sleeve for a while. All of those efforts paid big dividends last year, when he carved out a spot on the PGA Tour and nearly stole the show at the U.S. Open.His runner-up finish at Pinehurst nudged Compton and his story into the spotlight \u2014 and earned him an invitation to Augusta. It was something he'd longed to do since watching the tournament on TV as a kid.\"For me, it was a bit difficult to watch so many years and think, I'm never going to play in the Masters, just because of other issues that I've had. But yet, I just love to watch the Masters. So it's going to be weird,\" he said to laughter, \"not watching the Masters this year.\"Compton's wife, Barbara, and parents Peter and Eli won't be tuning in this year, either, making the drive up from Florida to watch Erik play in person. It's a well-deserved reward to be sure, since all of them had a hand in the push-pull climb toward the top of the golf hill.After walking most his son's practice round, Peter Compton recalled how motivated Erik was, no matter how tough things seemed. Six months after Hurricane Andrew hit the Miami area in 1992, forcing the family out of their home and into temporary housing alongside a golf course near Doral, he took his son to play a few holes.\"We were in a cart and back then, he liked driving more than playing,\" Peter recalled. \"But every time we'd leave the tee, he'd drive to his ball, and he was already hitting it 225 (yards) or so. So finally, about the third time it happened, I had to remind him, 'Hey, stop here. Let me play MY tee shots!'\"He started playing junior tournaments in the area after that and a lot of the fathers would come up and tell me what a terrific story it was,\" Peter said. \"But it wasn't long after that Erik started winning those tournaments. ... He could have sat back, said he'd been dealt a bad hand and did nothing. So I think that's what we're most proud of \u2014 he refused to give up.\"Compton tries to strike a delicate balance between those accomplishments and his aspirations. After a promising 2014 campaign on the big tour, his breakthrough performance at Pinehurst \u2014 only the second major he qualified to play. But Compton struggled this year, opening the 2015 season with a tie for 10th. He then wrestled with his driver and missed the cut in his next five tournaments.At the moment, most of his energy and focus are devoted to keeping the ball in play\"I'm here in the press room at the Masters, and that's a great thing,\" he said. \"But I don't look at myself as somebody who is a role model ... I look at myself as a golfer who has used golf as a means to maybe put some of the tough stuff that's happened to me in the past. Golf's been very therapeutic for me over the years.\"As I'm sitting here today,\" Compton concluded, \"I view myself as somebody who is going to try to do the best he can to compete in the Masters.\"",

    "Since our very earliest interest in boys, most of us have been searching for the perfect man. At 10 and 11, we flip through teeny-bopper magazines equating perfection to pre-pubescent members of boy bands, and from there, for the rest of our lives, we\u2019re focused on the idea of finding the one \u2014\u00a0the ideal man \u2014 who is perfect in every single possible way.PHOTOS: 10 Celebrities With Famous Body PartsWhether we go for the tall and mysterious type or the short, chubby man who is funnier and smarter than he is good-looking, we all have our own version of what constitutes perfection. (Personally, I\u2019d take Zach Galafianakis over Ryan Gosling, because that\u2019s what perfect looks like to me. I used to think I was alone in this, but maybe not so much after all.)A new study by men\u2019s British clothing company Jacamo found that 72 percent of U.K. ladies would gladly take the \u201cboy next door\u201d look over the look of \u201cluscious hulks.\u201dI can\u2019t say I\u2019m entirely surprised based on some of my friends\u2019 boyfriends \u2015 I kid! Our preference aside, the study also found that what we consider to be utter perfection, and what men think women find \"ideal\" are two completely different animals. In fact, 62 percent of men seem to think that women want a man with Hugh Jackman\u2019s arms, Justin Bieber\u2019s hair, Gerard Butler\u2019s face, footballer Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s legs, and David Gandy\u2019s torso. (What the wha \u2015?!)WATCH: Three Kettelbell Moves to Sculpt Your ArmsFirst of all, I had to Google David Gandy (so hot), and secondly, Justin Bieber\u2019s hair? I\u2019d take Louis C.K.\u2019s lack of hair over that kid\u2019s silly mop top any day. And while I don\u2019t think every woman I know would agree with me on that exactly, I do think no female over the age of 14 is going to be posting \u201cI\u2019m looking for a man who, ideally, has Justin Bieber\u2019s hair,\" on their online dating profile.While pasted all together, it does make for one delicious man, the reality is that we, the women of the world, are into something a little bit different, and according to the study, it\u2019s a man with a bit more fluff and charisma. What do we want? \u201cPrince Harry\u2019s hair, James Corden\u2019s face, Paddy McGuinness\u2019 arms, Ben Cohen\u2019s torso, and Jonathan Ross\u2019 legs,\u201d to be exact. Basically, based on the composite, we want the result to look like Seth Rogen. Women want Seth Rogen. Imagine that.But no matter whose face and body women put together to make Mr. Perfect, the outcome is still the same: We want real men, as opposed to cardboard cutouts or Photoshopped abs with great lighting. We want men with personality, soft, cozy middle sections, and someone who can make us laugh. That\u2019s what we all want.READ: 10 Ways to Fake a Hot BodyNow, if only Jacamo could do the same study but focusing on what men consider to be perfect. Not to be judgmental, but I have a sneaking suspicion that the bodyparts men throw together to create the perfect woman is going to prove which gender is far less superficial.

    "Sign in to comment!By Kelley Beaucar VlahosAl-Shabaab\u2019s deadly attack last week in Kenya, and threats of more to come, raise new security questions for President Obama\u2019s planned trip to the East African country this summer \u2013 though the White House so far is making no changes to the schedule.The president\u2019s planned visit to his father\u2019s homeland was announced late last month. It would mark Obama\u2019s first as president to Kenya, a country he hasn\u2019t visited in nearly a decade and he skipped over two years ago during an Africa tour despite stopping by neighboring Tanzania.At the time, the White House cited concerns over Kenya\u2019s elections and the indictment of President Uhuru Kenyatta before the International Criminal Court.Those charges have since been dropped. And Kenya is now etched onto Obama\u2019s itinerary, with the U.S. president planning to travel there in July for bilateral meetings and the 2015 Global Entrepreneurship Summit.But the terror rampage at Garissa University College was a grim reminder of the logistical and security challenge for the president\u2019s team, and of the growing threat posed by al-Shabaab. The attack on the northern Kenya university killed nearly 150 people and was followed by a warning from the Somalia-based terror group that Kenyan cities \u201cwill run red with blood,\u201d according to the SITE intelligence group.\u201cTheir objective right now is to get attention,\u201d said Peter Pham, an Africa expert at the Atlantic Council, adding that the terror group is \u201cchanging its model\u201d from a \u201cmajor insurgent threat\u201d to, increasingly, \u201ca transnational terrorist group.\u201dA presidential visit would, for a brief period, put the international spotlight on Kenya. Pham said al-Shabaab, while good at hitting \u201csoft targets,\u201d so far has avoided government buildings and other fortifications and would likely not attempt to \u201cstorm any majorly defended target\u201d like the meetings Obama would be attending.However, that might not stop them from plotting an attack against Kenyans while the president is in the country, for the kind of attention they\u2019re seeking.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be associated directly to the presidential visit, other than the timing,\u201d Pham said. \u201cAnything they do \u2026 will get them what they want, which is more media and exposure to the big leagues so to speak. The more reporters in the country heightens the risk.\u201dSo far, the White House insists the July trip will not be affected by terror concerns.\u201cWe don't believe that this will impact the president\u2019s travel there later this year,\u201d White House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters on Friday. \u201cWe feel very confident in the security precautions that will be in place when the president travels.\u201dObama\u2019s father, the late Barack Obama Sr., was born and raised in Kenya, and the president still has family there. The White House has not said whether Obama plans to visit relatives while in the country.The president on Friday called Kenya\u2019s president to express condolences over the recent attack. According to a White House statement, Obama also affirmed he looked forward to meeting with him in July, in Nairobi.The trip, according to the White House, is meant to \u201cbuild on the success of the August 2014 U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit and continue our efforts to work with countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including Kenya, to accelerate economic growth, strengthen democratic institutions, and improve security.\u201dAl-Shabaab, which rose from the ashes of civil war in neighboring Somalia, has been linked to Al Qaeda and was also responsible for massacring non-Muslims in June and November 2014 as they were traveling on buses in Kenya near the Somali border.Before that, the Islamist group was responsible for the attack at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi in 2013, killing 67 people.Aside from launching attacks on non-Muslims, the group has also vowed revenge against Kenya and other neighboring nations for sending troops to Somalia in 2011 in support of the weakened central government there.But Thursday\u2019s attack on mostly Christians at the college was the deadliest act of terrorism in Kenya since the Al Qaeda bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi in 1998, which killed 213 people, including 12 Americans, and injured 4,000. It calls into question whether the Kenyan government can keep its people safe, and whether al-Shabaab might try to stage an attack to take advantage of the world\u2019s attention during Obama\u2019s visit.Robert McFadden, senior vice president and counterterrorism analyst with the Soufan Group who served as a chief investigator for Naval Criminal Investigative Service after the USS Cole bombing by Al Qaeda in 2000, told FoxNews.com that it \u201cwould absolutely be a goal for any violent extremist anywhere\u201d to disrupt an American president\u2019s visit.\u201cBut there is a big delta between what [terrorists] would like to do and its capability and its capacity,\u201d he added.He believes that Kenyan security forces \u2013 though criticized for their response in the Westgate Mall attack \u2013 are robust enough to meet the challenge of securing Nairobi ahead of the July conference, which will also host a number of international dignitaries and industry leaders. Those forces already have launched attacks against al-Shabaab positions in Somalia after the college massacre.\u201cThe Kenyan government has a good handle on the security posture, but will also be augmented by the full capabilities of the United States,\u201d McFadden said. Further, \u201cthe president is not going to go anywhere that his most trusted advisers and the people at the very top of the [U.S.] security apparatus advise against.\u201dWhile Obama has traveled to countries in fragile circumstances before, like Afghanistan and Iraq, those places offered the benefit of an entrenched U.S. military presence.\u00a0There is a tiny U.S. military footprint in Kenya but no large American bases, and certainly not in Nairobi.But Kenya is not at war, and its government is working closely with the U.S. amid this ongoing al-Shabaab threat, McFadden said.\u201cThe threat level right now for the country isn\u2019t much beyond what it is for some of the neighboring countries \u2013 Somalia notwithstanding,\u201d he said. Plus, \u201cthe amount of information, intelligence, care and planning that goes into these trips for the president and vice president is absolutely extraordinary anywhere they go.\u201dThat planning is typically led by U.S. Secret Service, which will marshal its resources months ahead to plot a wide perimeter of security around the president during his time there.When contacted by FoxNews.com, U.S. Secret Service spokesman Robert Hoback said he could not talk about the \u201cmeans and methods\u201d of that planning.51%47%13%75%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

    "Sign in to comment!By Lauren BlanchardSmart glove makes controlling smartphones simpleA group of Boston techies is taking smartphone gloves to a new level by turning them into a \u00a0remote control for your phone.\nThey\u2019re calling the technology the GoGlove. It\u2019s is a way to control your smartphone with the tap of a finger.\nBen Harris, co-founder of Easier to Use, which developed the GoGlove, said the idea came to him while he was out on the slopes with some friends. The time it took to take his phone out of his pocket, take off his gloves, change the song or adjust the volume, and then put everything back, put him way behind the rest of the group, who he said were already to the bottom of the hill. Harris knew he wanted to come up with an easier way to use his phone without needing to touch the screen.\n\"We're finding people love being able to control their phone remotely. They\u2019re leaving their phone in their pocket or purse and are really able to have the same control of their phone as if it were in their hand,\u201d he said.\nThe GoGlove is designed to allow people running, biking, walking or hitting the slopes to use their music, camera, GoPro, or listen to texts by tapping their fingers rather than taking the phone out and manually using it.\n\u201cWhatever your phone can do, you can control with GoGlove,\u201d said Harris.\nA Bluetooth module in the glove is connected to sensors in the fingertips, according to GoGlove Designer Eric Ely. Each sensor controls different functions on the phone when it\u2019s tapped.\n\"It\u2019s all based on the magnet in your thumb and the sensor on your finger tip,\" he said. \"You just tap the magnet to the individual finger\u2026 as well as one at the base of your index finger.\"\nEly said that GoGlove\u2019s main purpose is to give users more control over their devices. By connecting the gloves to the GoGlove app, the user can set the function that each finger controls.\n\u201cIt's a great concept when you\u2019re flying down the mountain and a good song comes on and you kind of get in that moment and that makes everything better,\" he explained. \"Really we are just trying to make that experience easier to control.\u201d\u00a0\nThe gloves are meant to be lightweight so they can fit inside thicker gloves in the winter. Harris said that, in testing, bigger gloves haven\u2019t interfered with the magnets. Ely said that the GoGlove was also designed to be easily hand washed and with an active user in mind. He said the material is resistant to sweat and light moisture. \u00a0\nHarris added that the GoGlove\u2019s Bluetooth module can be removed from the glove and used in warmer weather. The module can be clipped onto a shirt or bike and can still control the smartphone.\nGoGlove is on Kickstarter where Harris and his team are trying to get funding to take the gloves into production. Right now the GoGlove can be preordered for $79, about 40 percent cheaper than it will retail for next year.\nHowever, Harris said that, once the project is funded on Kickstarter, the price will bump up to about $129. The goal is to get the gloves into production by summer and onto shelves by ski season 2015.Lauren Blanchard is part of the Junior Reporter program at Fox News.

    "HARTFORD, Conn. \u2013 \u00a0Thousands of Connecticut taxpayers could potentially receive a lucrative financial windfall.U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal said Friday he has learned there is $13.4 million worth of unclaimed tax refunds from 2011 currently owed to Connecticut taxpayers. The bulk of that money, he said, is owed to people who didn't claim the federal Earned Income Tax Credit.The program is available for people with moderate incomes. It reduces the amount of taxes someone owes or it could result in a refund. The credit varies based on income and family size. In 2011, it was worth as much as $5,751 for families with three or more children and earning less than $43,998 a year, or $49,078 for those married and filing jointly.\"This $13 million can have real life consequences,\" said Blumenthal, who was joined Friday at the YWCA facility in Hartford with human services and tax advocates.Blumenthal said he came up with the idea to check on the amount of unclaimed refunds owed to Connecticut taxpayers after discussing the issue with some fellow senators. He said the IRS told him there are more than 13,400 Connecticut residents who haven't yet filed their 2011 tax returns. Some of those people might not have met the income threshold for filing a federal tax return but still might have qualified for the earned income tax credit.According to the IRS, federal income tax refunds totaling $1 billion nationally may be waiting for an estimated one million taxpayers who didn't file a federal return for 2011. The IRS estimates half of the potential refunds are more than $698. The potential median refund for Connecticut taxpayers is $777.\"Time is running out for people who didn't file a 2011 federal income tax return to claim their refund,\" said IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, adding that many students and part-time workers could also be eligible for refunds. The IRS said there is no penalty for filing a late tax return that qualifies for a refund.Blumenthal urged residents needing help with tax preparation to visit Volunteer Income Tax Assistance sites, which offers free tax preparation for individuals with household incomes of up to $53,000. Taxpayers can call 211 to find locations and set up appointments.There is a three-year grace period for claiming a refund.\"Once April 15 comes and goes, the refunds for 2011 are gone,\" said Blumenthal, who jokingly urged people not to leave the money on the table for the federal government to \"devour.\" The IRS said the unclaimed money becomes property of the U.S. Treasury.The tax return must be properly addressed, mailed and postmarked by April 15.Laura O'Keefe, coordinator of the family financial stability initiative at The Village for Families and Children in Hartford, told the story of a single mother she helped several years ago with her taxes. O'Keefe said the woman didn't know she was eligible for the EITC for several years and wound up receiving a $10,000 federal tax income.O'Keefe said the woman was in foreclosure at the time and was able to use the money to save her home. The refund also helped the woman free up money to pay for food and her family's other needs at local stores and businesses.\"This not only impacts individuals and families,\" she said. \"It impacts communities as a whole.\"+ FollowFox Business on FacebookMorning Biz Outlook\u00a0\u203a",

    "Sign in to comment!Kenya launches airstrikes against Al-Shabaab in SomaliaGARISSA, Kenya \u2013 \u00a0Kenya's military said Monday that it had launched airstrikes against Islamist positions in Somalia after a terror attack at a university that killed 148 people last week.Military spokesman Col David Obonyo told the Associated Press that warplanes had attacked positions held by the al-Shabaab terror group in the Gedo region of Somalia beginning Sunday afternoon and continuing into Monday morning. Gedo is directly across Kenya's border in western Somalia.\"This is part of continuing operations, not just in response to Garissa,\" he said, a reference to the town in northeastern Nigeria where the attack occurred.Al-Shabaab had previously claimed responsibility for the deadly attack on Garissa University College in northeastern Kenya and vowed to carry out others in response to Kenya sending troops to Somalia in 2011 to do battle with the terror group after gunmen carried out cross-border raids and kidnappings.\"No amount of precaution or safety measures will be able to guarantee your safety, thwart another attack or prevent another bloodbath,\" said al-Shabaab.Four al-Shabaab attackers were killed Thursday to end the siege and their bullet-ridden bodies were later displayed in Garissa.Meanwhile, more disturbing information was revealed about Thursday's attack, as authorities said Sunday that one of the al-Shabaab gunmen who attacked the campus has been identified as the son of a Kenyan government official.Abdirahim Mohammed Abdullahi was the son of a government chief in Mandera County, Interior Ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka told The Associated Press. The chief had reported his son missing last year and said he feared he had gone to Somalia, said Njoka. Abdullahi and three other attackers were killed by Kenyan security forces on Thursday.Abdullahi graduated from the University of Nairobi with a law degree in 2013 and was viewed as a \"brilliant upcoming lawyer,\" according to someone who knew him. It is not clear where he worked before he disappeared last year, Njoka said.To prevent an escalation of Islamic radicalization in Kenya, it is important that parents inform authorities if their children go missing or show tendencies of following violent extremism, said Njoka.Kenyans make up the largest number of foreign fighters in al-Shabaab, according to experts. Hundreds of Kenyan youths have trained with al-Shabaab and then returned to Kenya, posing a major security threat, according to former police chief Mathew Iteere.Kenya's government has said another source of instability is the country's refugee camps. The Dadaab Camp-- which houses nearly 500,000 refugees-- is the center for the \"the training, the coordination, the assembling of terror networks,\" claimed Aden Duale, a parliament majority leader.Questions have been raised about the security response to the Garissa attack. Police waited seven hours before sending a special tactical unit into the college to fight the gunmen, Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper reported Sunday.When the specially trained police finally went in, it took them only 30 minutes to kill the four attackers and stop the siege, the paper said.Army barracks are just 540 yards from the college, and military officers said they could handle the attack, said a police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. Only after three soldiers were killed did the army call in the police tactical unit, he said.Relatives of some of the Garissa attack victims gathered at a funeral home in Nairobi Monday to view their loved ones and pray. A funeral home employee read out some of the victims\u2019 names before their relatives went inside to mourn in private. Many emerged in tears.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

The special\u2019s air date falls on the second day of TV\u2019s May sweeps period.ABC News declined to offer much detail on the content of the talks, but said in a statement that the interview was \u201cfar-ranging and exclusive\u201d and would appear as a special two-hour edition of \u201c20/20\u2033 starting at 9 p.m. Eastern on Friday, April 24.ABC\u2019s ability to secure the interview may raise eyebrows, as Jenner has long appeared on NBCUniversal\u2019s E! as part of his involvement with the Kardashian family whose reality show is a staple of that network\u2019s schedule. As such, executives at NBC News may have thought they had an early in on such a conversation.Jenner, whose recent appearance has spurred discussion the former athlete may have undergone a sex change, had been married to Kris Jenner, the mother of the Kardashian children, and has been part of that show for many seasons.Advertisement",

    "U.S. stocks rose on Monday as expectations the Federal Reserve could hold off longer on raising interest rates offset concerns over Friday's surprisingly weak jobs report.The jobs report was well below expectations, with data showing U.S. employers last month added the fewest jobs in more than a year.Underscoring the economic weakness, an ISM report on Monday showed the pace of growth in the U.S. services sector fell in March to its lowest level in three months.\"The weekend allowed market participants to see the positive side of the weak Friday (jobs) number, which is that rates probably aren't going to rise very quickly,\" said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.The Fed is expected to raise rates for the first time in almost a decade later this year if the economy, especially the labor market, keeps improving.The S&P utilities sector, which tends to outperform in low interest rate environments, rose 1.3 percent, making it among the best-performing sectors of the day.The S&P energy sector, up 1.8 percent, led gains as U.S. crude oil futures jumped 6.1 percent after Saudi Arabia raised its price for sales to Asia and estimates for crude buildups fell.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 117.61 points, or 0.66 percent, to 17,880.85, the S&P 500 gained 13.66 points, or 0.66 percent, to 2,080.62 and the Nasdaq Composite added 30.38 points, or 0.62 percent, to 4,917.32.The lackluster economic data also eased some concerns that the U.S. dollar would continue to strengthen and pressure the earnings of companies with international exposure.\"So far the data continues to suggest the economy remains weaker, not stronger,\" said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York.Adding to the day's bullish tone, New York Fed President William Dudley said the central bank will need to determine whether that jobs report foreshadows a more substantial slowing in the labor market, adding he expects the path of rate hikes to be \"relatively shallow.\"U.S.-listed shares of Amsterdam-based Uniqure jumped 47 percent to $33.61 after a deal with Bristol-Myers Squibb to develop gene therapies for cardiovascular diseases.Tesla Motors added 6.3 percent to $203.10 after it reported a 55 percent increase in deliveries in the first quarter.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 2,217 to 836, for a 2.65-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,505 issues rose and 1,262 fell for a 1.19-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.The benchmark S&P 500 index posted 24 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 74 new highs and 25 new lows.About 6.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, matching the daily average for the last five sessions, according to data from BATS Global Markets.(Additional reporting by Rodrigo Campos; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Meredith Mazzilli)+ FollowFox Business on FacebookMorning Biz Outlook\u00a0\u203a",
    "Sign in to comment!(ap)FALL RIVER, Mass. \u2013 \u00a0The defense rested Monday in the murder trial of former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez after a doctor testified that PCP can cause people to be suddenly violent, even days after smoking it.Hernandez has pleaded not guilty in the June 17, 2013, killing of Odin Lloyd, who was shot six times at an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's home in North Attleborough. Lloyd was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. At the time of the killing, Hernandez had a $40 million contract with the Patriots.Hernandez lawyer James Sultan called just three witnesses.The first was Dr. David Greenblatt, a professor at Tufts University School of Medicine, who testified about the effects of the drug PCP. Hernandez's cousin testified that his two co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, were smoking what she thought was PCP the weekend the crime occurred. Both men have pleaded not guilty and will be tried later.Prosecutor Patrick Bomberg went after Greenblatt's testimony, showing surveillance video of Ortiz, Wallace and Hernandez from Hernandez's home before and immediately after the killing. In the videos, the men do not appear to be acting strangely.\"This is essentially three minutes after the murder \u2014 you'd expect to see something lingering of PCP psychosis or intoxication,\" Bomberg said, asking if Greenblatt could detect such behavior.\"You just can't tell,\" Greenblatt replied.After the defense rested, prosecutors then called a rebuttal witness to testify about PCP. That witness, Dr. Martin Brecher, a psychiatrist, said it was wrong to associate PCP and violence. Brecher wrote a paper reviewing cases of PCP over decades.After the prosecutor finished questioning Brecher, the judge called for a recess and sent the jury out of the room.Testimony earlier Monday by two other witnesses related to DNA on a shell casing found inside a silver Nissan Altima that Hernandez rented, which prosecutors say he used to drive Lloyd to his death. When police found the shell casing in a trash bin at a rental car agency, it was stuck to chewed blue bubble gum that also was found in the Nissan. In testing, Hernandez's DNA was found on the shell casing. The defense has argued it got there from the bubble gum.The judge has said she expects closing arguments to be delivered Tuesday or Wednesday.",

    "Sign in to comment!By Ruth RavveIllinois workers file lawsuit to end mandatory union duesThe future of public and private unions in two big labor-friendly states may be at stake as foes mount aggressive legal challenges over the long-controversial practice of mandatory dues.The court cases in Illinois and California revolve around so-called \"fair share\" payments, or the dues unions extract from workers whose jobs stand to benefit from collective bargaining -- whether or not the workers are technically union members. Unions argue workers should have to pay their \"fair share\" of the costs of negotiating and administering a union contract, so they\u2019re not getting a free ride from the union\u2019s efforts.But workers are often surprised to see money taken from their paychecks, without their consent.\u201cI really found out about it when I got my first paycheck and there was the fair share that was pulled out,\u201d said Mark Janus, who works as a child support specialist with the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services.The fees taken out of Janus\u2019 check amounted to about $46 a month, every month, for the eight years he\u2019s been on the job.\u00a0\u201cI figured I\u2019d paid over $4,000 so far,\u201d he said. The money Janus unintentionally paid went to the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, also known as AFSCME, which represents employees in his office.Janus is now one of three plaintiffs who have joined with Republican Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner in a lawsuit to overturn the state's so-called fair share law.\u201cI don't feel that the union represents me 100 percent in what I believe and what I like to do,\u201d Janus explained. \u201cAnd nobody asked me if I wanted to join the union, they just said 'here's a job, you're in the union.'\"The intention of the lawsuit is to get a federal judge in Chicago, and ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court, to declare the fee for non-member dues unconstitutional.In addition, Rauner issued an executive order with the same purpose.\u201cThis is a fundamental issue protecting employees\u2019 rights, their freedom of speech, and their rights as employees,\u201d Rauner said.But Tim Drea, the Illinois AFL-CIO secretary treasurer, said \u201call state employees benefit from what the unions do on wages and bargaining ... health care and pension benefits.\u201dWhile the fair share law requires that no money raised from the fees be used by the unions for political purposes, Rauner said that\u2019s not possible when it comes to a state employees union.\u201cBy their very nature government political activities are political. They\u2019re inside the government and advocating with politicians, so by definition it\u2019s all political,\u201d Rauner told Fox News.On the West Coast, a similar battle is taking place that some claim could put an end to the teachers' union.In Friedrich v. California Teachers\u2019 Association, 10 teachers filed suit over a state law requiring dues to the union they don\u2019t support.\u00a0The teachers said the law violates their constitutional rights.The fair-share labor law was formed as a result of a 1977 court case called Abood v. The Detroit Board of Education. In that case, public school teachers in Detroit sought to overturn a requirement that they pay dues to the teachers' union on the grounds they didn\u2019t support the union activities or collective bargaining.The court sided with the unions and determined that non-members can be charged fees, though the money from fees could not be used for political purposes.Since that decision came down, about half the states in the U.S. -- the ones that are not right-to-work states -- require workers in union-backed jobs who don\u2019t want to join a union to pay their \u201cfair share.\u201dIn the Midwest, where auto workers, Teamsters and other unions have had a stronghold for years, the right-to-work plan has been met with massive protests and multiple court battles -- yet right-to-work laws have passed in Michigan, Wisconsin and Indiana.Now that battle lines are being draw in Illinois, the Land of Lincoln state may become the last stand in America\u2019s heartland for the unions.\u00a0Without a policy of mandatory dues, unions anywhere stand to lose revenue and members.\u201cIn half the other states in the U.S., government workers have a right to choose whether they will give money to a union. In Illinois, government workers don't have the right to make that choice,\u201d said Jacob Huebert, an attorney for the Liberty Justice Center, which is representing plaintiffs in the Illinois lawsuit.Huebert said he\u2019s encouraged to test the issue because of the court\u2019s response to another challenge to the union dues requirement by an Illinois woman named Pam Harris.Harris didn\u2019t want to have to pay dues to a state workers union just because she\u2019d taken on a job as home health care worker for her mentally and physically disabled son. The Supreme Court ruled that Harris was not a state employee and therefore didn\u2019t have to pay dues.As part of its opinion in the Harris case, the court stated that the Abood decision may not withstand a challenge. The Liberty Justice Center was inspired to mount that challenge.Labor leaders, who plan to \u201cmount a vigorous defense\u201d to the lawsuits, claim opponents are just trying to weaken and choke off unions in general, especially in Illinois where negotiations for a new contract are taking place.Drea said he feels confident the court will rule in favor of the fair-share decision, but he worries the continuous battle resulting in right-to-work states \u201cis just a further continuation of the race to the bottom\u201d for Americans.Drea also warned that a blow to the unions would be a blow to middle-class America. \u201cWe believe the unions built the middle class and we're going to do everything we can to make sure the middle class survives,\u201d he said.The Supreme Court may decide before summer whether to take on the California case.As for the Illinois case, a federal judge in Chicago will decide on it first, though the plaintiffs hope it eventually makes it to the high court as well.45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

He will likely be one of the only Western leaders to attend, as other heads of state plan to boycott the ceremony to protest Russia's role in the ongoing conflict with Ukraine.Schapiro told Czech television early last week that while he recognized the Russian contribution to the Allies' military triumph, \"standing on a platform reviewing a military parade at a time when that military is destabilizing a European nation is not really a good message to send.\"The U.S. Embassy has not commented on Zeman's reported remark.

    "Sign in to comment!By Lee RossWill Rand Paul have an advantage in early primary states?BOWLING GREEN, Ky. \u2013 \u00a0Still glum over the previous night's Final Four loss by the heavily favored Kentucky Wildcats, Sen. Rand Paul and fellow parishioners were given some Biblical perspective Sunday morning.\"If it weren't for Jesus, we'd all be one and done,\" a churchgoer at the Broadway United Methodist Church explained to nods of agreement at the start of Easter service.When the service ended, Paul left the sanctuary, posed for one picture and shook a few hands while the other congregants quickly passed by without so much as a double take of the man in the nicely pressed suit. They were seemingly unaware that Paul, who had just worshipped with them, would in 48 hours announce his presidential ambitions in a nationally televised speech.The Tuesday speech -- perhaps the most important of his political career -- didn't seem foremost on Paul's mind, either. Instead, it was getting behind the wheel of his American-made SUV and waiting for his wife Kelley and youngest son to emerge from the church tucked away inside an unassuming neighborhood.The low-key family church outing (involving no aides, security or other hangers-on) is fully in line with the man Paul's Bowling Green friends describe.\"He's not the guy who makes a point of standing out in a crowd,\" Brian Strow explained.March 20, 2105: Sen., Rand Paul, R-Ky. speaks in Manchester, N.H.\u00a0(AP)In interviews with Fox News, Strow, an economics professor at Western Kentucky University, and other Paul friends talked about the man they've known for the past couple decades as simply \"Rand\" or \"Dr. Paul\" -- before he became the firebrand lawmaker known for his libertarian streak and, more recently, lofty ambitions.\"He was a good guy before he became senator,\" Rob Porter noted.The Republican senator's arrival to Bowling Green, a place where people still wave to out-of-towners who pass by, has been fairly well documented. Growing up, Paul followed his parents from Pennsylvania to Texas before getting his medical degree in North Carolina with some time in Georgia, too. It was there that Paul met Kelley, but it's here in south-central Kentucky they've raised their three children.\"When I moved to Bowling Green -- [I was told if] you have a problem with your eye, you go see Dr. Paul,\" Travis Creed explained about his ophthalmologist friend and neighbor.Another friend figures that Paul's early focus on his medical practice and parental responsibilities kept him from fully engaging in politics. But Paul still had his eye on shaping public policy.(FNC)In 2004, Strow was running for a spot on the city commission when he says Paul, whom he had never met, cold-called him offering assistance. Paul explained that he liked some of the positions Strow was taking -- especially on taxes -- and offered to host a fundraiser.Strow won the race but says the measure of Paul's character shined through when the city was considering a proposal to publicly bankroll a $25 million stadium for a minor league baseball team. Paul opposed the idea. Strow voted for it anyway.\"That annoyed Rand to no end,\" Strow recalled with a slight chuckle. Strow then added that Paul didn't hold a personal grudge or needlessly needle his new friend about that vote. \"It speaks well of him.\"Similarly, Paul opposed a property tax hike Warren County Executive Mike Buchanon felt was necessary.\"I always found him direct and honest even when he disagreed with me,\" Buchanon said. \"He's a very serious guy about the things you're supposed to be serious about.\"While some were surprised about Paul's decision to run for Senate five years ago, Porter, a banker in Bowling Green, said he saw signs that Paul's political ambitions were calling.First, Paul was regularly writing letters to newspaper editors -- usually about taxes since he founded an advocacy group dedicated to fighting increased taxation. Then in 2008, Paul's father, former Rep. Ron Paul, made a run for the White House.\"People saw in Rand, maybe, a place for him on the U.S. stage while speaking for his dad\" during that campaign, Porter said.The rap on Paul by some of his detractors is that he's out of the mainstream and in some ways an isolationist, though it's a label he denies. If he enters, as expected, on Tuesday, he'll automatically be in a race against the hawkish Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who has announced his presidential bid and is sure to challenge Paul on his national security credentials.Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., another security-focused Republican weighing a bid, took a few swipes at Paul during a local Chamber of Commerce event in South Carolina on Monday, accusing his fellow senator of having a foreign policy \"to the left of President Obama.\" It's a narrative Paul would have to confront early on in the primaries.But if Paul were to run and win the White House, there's at least one thing about him that's in the mainstream of modern presidents: He's a golfer.Paul has a reputation as a good player, often shooting in the 80's. He likes to walk and is chatty on the course. Before his Senate election, he frequently played at the Bowling Green Country Club -- which is more country than club -- on the outskirts of town.The Graves-Gilbert Clinic in Bowling Green, where Sen. Rand Paul worked for many years before starting his own practice.\u00a0(FNC)Fox News is told Paul can be competitive on the course where he'll work on a swing tip he's picked up or engage in some good-natured trash talking with a member of his foursome. This is especially true if there's something at stake on the outcome of the match -- often a Diet Coke.When the round's done, Paul isn't likely to linger too long at the course. As one friend described, \"daddy duty\" encourages a swift departure to take his boys to sporting events, practices or other school-related activities.The Paul family lives in a gated community 10 minutes from downtown. Friends describe it as a tight-knit neighborhood where summer cookouts are popular.\"Kelley is very engaging and social,\" Porter said. \"She makes you feel at home in their house.\"The kitchen and a back deck, which overlooks a community pond, tend to be the gravity points for everyone to gather. It's in this setting that Porter says \"[Rand]'s really become a Kentuckian,\" sipping bourbon with his guests.It shouldn't be a surprise that the friends Fox News spoke with support Paul's expected presidential bid.\"I want Rand to succeed in politics,\" Strow said. \"But if he doesn't, I'll be happy to have my eye doctor back.\"45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

    "Tax season affects everyone, but while homeowners can claim the mortgage interest deduction, most renters don\u2019t see many tax savings. Some states do have renter tax credits, but they generally provide minimal savings.Renters shouldn\u2019t fret, however. Most American homeowners actually get little, if any, tax benefits from owning real estate \u2014 although many believe they do.The Mortgage Interest Deduction amount homeowners claim on their taxes goes on their Schedule A: Itemized Deductions. Also on that form are a variety of other deductions for items such as medical expenses, property taxes, casualty losses, and gifts to charity. At the bottom of that form, taxpayers summarize all those deductions as the total Itemized Deduction.If the sum of all those deductions is not higher than $12,400 for married couples or $6,200 for singles, the taxpayer will elect to take the free government-given Standard Deduction. In effect, they are not \u201citemizing\u201d on their tax return because their total itemized deductions are not above the Standard Deduction, so they elect to take the Standard Deduction.Taxpayers who take the Standard Deduction \u2014 estimated at up to 70 percent of Americans, many of whom are homeowners \u2014 get no actual interest deduction tax benefit from owning their home. This puts them in the same boat as renters.With the average home in the U.S. costing around $200,000, and the average mortgage interest rate around 4.5 percent, that amounts to about $9,000 per year in mortgage interest. Since that\u2019s over the Single Standard Deduction limit, single people might get a little tax benefit from itemizing the deduction, but it\u2019s less than the average Married Standard Deduction limit, so married folks would probably not get any benefit.That\u2019s right: many Americans get little tax benefit from owning a home.So relax, renters. You\u2019re not missing out on any big tax break, and shouldn\u2019t be in a rush to buy. When you have stable income, plan to stay in one place for a long time, and are ready to take on the tasks of homeownership, that\u2019s the time to buy a home.More From Zillow:The Case for Renting: Homeownership Isn\u2019t for Everyone\n15 Cities Where Renting Rules\nShould You Rent From a Friend?Note: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the opinion or position of Zillow.+ FollowFox Business on FacebookMore\u203aInvesting\u203a",

    "Sign in to comment!By Leah GinsbergWhich seat do you prefer? (iStock)Choosing your seat on an airplane is a big deal. People obsessively check SeatGuru.com before picking a seat or even pay more for a certain position on the plane. Why? \u201cIt\u2019s a rare opportunity to have some control over your environment when traveling,\u201d explains psychologist and University of Washington professor Jonathan Bricker, Ph.D. \u201cThat\u2019s very significant for the traveler.\u201d Indeed \u2013 ask people whether they\u2019re an aisle or window person, and they don\u2019t hesitate to answer. (In case you're wondering, based on Expedia.com customers who indicated a seat preference, 55 percent prefer a window seat and 45 percent prefer an aisle seat.) So Yahoo Travel researched, asked the experts, and picked the brains of frequent fliers to find out what your seat choice says about you.If you\u2019re an aisle person:ADVERTISEMENTYou value freedom. \u201cChoosing an aisle seat is an expression of freedom. You know you have the ability to get up and walk around without having to ask anyone or climb over your seatmate,\u201d says Bricker.You\u2019re an introvert. When stuck in a large group of people (as you are on plane \u2013 sometimes for hours) introverts fee lphysically uncomfortable and tend to want to stay on the periphery and have an easy escape route (even if it\u2019s just in their heads), and they don\u2019t like to be surrounded by people or objects on all sides. The aisle seats checks those boxes more than any other.You\u2019re all business. No gazing out the window and daydreaming for you. Plus it\u2019s usually much more comfortable to sleep at the window, so you\u2019ll likely be up working or reading a book. In fact, a recent American Express Global Business Travel survey found that business travelers prefer aisle seats.You like to be in the power position. You\u2019re the first one to talk to the flight attendant when she asks what you want to drink. You control your seatmates in a sense \u2013 middle and window people need to ask you to go the bathroom \u2013 and you can set the tone for the interaction by either being nice or grumpy about it. You\u2019re the de facto dictator of the row.You tend to be a bit claustrophobic. Sitting on the aisle is about as much open space as you get on board. (Too bad you can\u2019t sit on the wing.)Are you cool with the middle seat? (iStock)If you\u2019re a window person:You value privacy. When you choose the window, there\u2019s a wall on one side, so for the most part, you\u2019re insulated enough that you won\u2019t be affected by other people\u2019s behavior, explains Bricker. And you won\u2019t have your seatmate asking you to move so he can go to the bathroom.You\u2019re a nester. \u201cYou can create your own little own space by the window,\u201d says Bricker. The spot feels cozier, and you can rest a pillow against the wall for more comfy naps. \u201cYou can create a little bit of a home,\u201d he says.You\u2019re a dreamer. Yahoo Travel\u2019s Editor in Chief, Paula Froelich, says she likes to look out the window because she can think about all the amazing places out there she can visit. We suspect she\u2019s not alone.You\u2019re open to new experiences. According to Brian Little, Ph.D., psychologist and author of Me, Myself and Us: The Science of Personality and the Art of Well-Being, the fact that the window allows you to watch the actual Rocky Mountains go by \u2013 which in your world that\u2019s so much better than watching an in-flight movie about the Rockies - belies this trait.If you\u2019re cool with the middle seat:You\u2019re an extrovert. \u201cOutgoing people like social contact,\u201d explains Little, so they wouldn\u2019t dread sitting between two strangers as much as others might. Yes, chatty Cathy, you\u2019rethat person on the plane.You\u2019re highly evolved. \u201cBeing okay with the middle seat, especially on a long flight, is an exercise in acceptance and willingness to allow what is be what is,\u201d says Bricker. \u201cIf you\u2019re able to give up your privacy and your autonomy, and realize it\u2019s just a moment in time that will pass, you\u2019re probably the most enlightened passenger on the plane.\u201dYou\u2019re considerate. Often, when someone chooses the aisle seat, it\u2019s because they\u2019re with a friend or partner, and they\u2019re doing it as a gift to the traveling companion, explains psychologist, Pauline Wallin, Ph.D.You\u2019re low man on the totem pole. If you\u2019re traveling with family or friends and you get stuck in the middle seat (as opposed to offering to sit there), it\u2019s probably because you\u2019re the one with the least amount of power in the group, says Wallin.You\u2019re disorganized. People who repeatedly end up with the middle seat may very well be there because they failed to sufficiently plan ahead. Get it together.If you only do business class:You\u2019re a control freak. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to have to choose between values \u2013 between freedom and comfort, for example,\u201d explains Bricker. \u201cPaying the extra money allows you to protect both. What you\u2019re really buying is opportunity to exercise these values.\u201d Plus, there\u2019s plenty of place to store your overhead luggage - no being forced to cram your stuff into leftover space.You value your time. It says a lot when you\u2019re willing to spend several times the price of a regular seat, and one of the perks of the business class ticket is that it comes with priority boarding, explains Bricker. Plus, being at the front of the plane allows you to get off more quickly, too.You\u2019re a little pretentious. Sometimes people like to fly business class because of how it appears to others \u2013 \u201cThey like that sense of privilege, of having something that other people can\u2019t,\u201d explains Wallin.You\u2019re rich. Obviously. Or your employer is. Or you have mega frequent-flyer miles.More from Yahoo!

    "It seems as though communication in business should be an easy concept to understand and quite straightforward. A customer asks a question and receives a response from the owner or employee. An employee has a question or offers an opinion to the owner and expects a reply. Unfortunately, the response may not adequately answer the question. It is deflected with negative phrases that do little to motivate the customer into making a purchase or returning to repeat the buying experience. A negative response to an employee, or worse no response, is one of the best ways to demotivate a potentially excellent employee.One negative phrase can \u201cturn off\u201d a customer or employee, but with a slight change of words the phrase can become positive. When the right words are used, they encourage customers to purchase, become loyal, and act as goodwill ambassadors for the business. Likewise, when words are chosen wisely, employees become committed to being a part of a growing and successful business.Phrases that motivate do not necessarily come without practice. The starting point is having a positive attitude. To solidify strong relationships, certain phrases should never be in a business vocabulary. Make sure your business dictionary has omitted these:1. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that.\u201dWhat a negative response! Maybe something can be done with the right attitude. Few things are impossible. In fact, with the right attitude, it is amazing what can be accomplished.What to say instead: \u201cWe\u2019ll see if we can do that.\u201d2. \u201cWe\u2019ll get to it later.\u201dProcrastination is never a remedy in business; it is nothing more than a delay tactic. Satisfied customers and loyal employees are not interested in waiting. When dealing with their concerns, they want someone to have a sense of urgency in handling their situation.What to say instead: \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of that ASAP.\u201d3. \u201cIt\u2019s not that important.\u201dTo a customer or employee, their needs are very important! The most important customer or employee a business has is the one they are dealing with at the present time.What to say instead: \u201cI certainly understand the importance of this.\u201d4. \u201cWhy so many questions?\u201dYes, we all know that some people ask many more questions than others, but they still need answers. If they\u2019re asking a question, it\u2019s important for them to receive an answer.What to say instead: \u201cI\u2019m happy to answer your questions.\u201d5. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he take his business elsewhere?\u201dThis is just the attitude a business owner never wants from his employees! Rather than helping to build a long-term sustainable, successful business, this attitude does just the opposite.What to say instead: \u201cWe\u2019re thankful for all business.\u201dAfter all, business pays the bills and creates jobs!With communication, it\u2019s about being positive or negative. On one end of the spectrum, communication can be negative and little or nothing gets accomplished. Customers go to the competition, and employees leave for other jobs. On the other end of the spectrum, communication can be positive. Customers return and employees are loyal. Often the difference between being positive or negative can simply be the choice of words.Make responses work for you!Take negative phrases out of your business vocabulary\u2014now! Make sure your employees get the message as well.Positive responses come with practice. It never hurts to do a little role-playing during employee training, so when an actual situation occurs there is an automatic, positive response. When the right words are used, you will see a big difference in customer and employee attitudes and reactions. Why waste the energy on negative phrases when positive ones take the same amount of effort but produce much greater results?More from AllBusiness.com:Richard L.

    "A video posted on YouTube shows an Uber driver as the target of roadside rage by a police detective in the West Village. The NYPD has confirmed that the plainclothes cop in the video is in fact a New York City detective. His name is Detective Patrick Cherry. The department has transferred him out of the Joint Terrorism Task Force.When the incident occurred, Cherry apparently didn't know a passenger in the back seat was recording the entire exchange on his cellphone camera. Now internal affairs and the civilian complaint review board are is investigating.The video shows the foul-mouthed rant. Then the cop slams the driver's door shut and walks back to his unmarked car. When the officer returns, the Uber driver tries to apologize, but the cop keeps yelling at the driver to shut up.\"I don't know what [expletive] planet you think you're on right now,\" the cops said.Uber says this happened during the day Monday and that no one knew the man was a cop because he wasn't wearing a uniform and he was driving an unmarked car. Plus, after approaching the car, he didn't immediately identify himself as a police officer.The passenger in the Uber car says the officer failed to use his blinker when parking his car. The Uber driver drove around him, honked his horn and gestured to the officer, to use his blinker. That is apparently what sent the officer into the rage. Several times, the cop also mocked the Uber driver's accent and broken English.The Uber driver was not given a ticket. He has filed a complaint with the NYPD about the tirade.Uber issued this statement saying \"The behavior in the video is wrong and unacceptable and we appreciate the NYPD investigating the incident.\"If the investigations determine that the detective was in the wrong he could face administrative prosecution. It will be up to the police commissioner to decide his punishment.Police Commissioner William Bratton said that Cherry's behavior was inappropriate.\"No good cop can watch that without a wince,\" Bratton said at a news conference on Wednesday. \"That officer's behavior reflected poorly on everyone who wears our uniform.\"The president of the union that represents detectives said Cherry should not be \"judged by one isolated incident.\"Watch the uncensored video here.With the AP and MyFoxNY.com staff.",

    "When I first met with my CPA in 2014, we did my 2013 taxes and I got a stack of estimated tax vouchers for 2014. I mailed those off at their respective times, and paid a total of $2,859 in estimated taxes, to match the numbers on the vouchers.I began to suspect, as we neared the end of 2014, that I might owe more in taxes than $2,859. My freelance income was consistently rising and I kept hearing other people say \u201cyou have to pay 20%, or 25%.\u201d I knew $2,859 was not quite enough to cover 20% of my 2014 income.So I told myself: \u201cNicole, in First Quarter 2015 you are going to put aside some money for extra taxes.\u201d When I met with my CPA in February, he said \u201cit looks like your income went up, so you are probably going to owe some extra taxes.\u201d If I had a Magic 8-Ball, it would be jumping up and down and screaming \u201cAll signs point to extra taxes!\u201dWell, now we know the actual number: $8,302 total, or the $2,859 I\u2019ve already paid plus $5,443 by April 15.I often present myself as the pluckiest person around; people have compared me to Kimmy Schmidt, which I\u2019m all um, no, but I get why they\u2019re doing it. Secretly, I\u2019m not always plucky. When I got the email with the $5,443 number I curled up in a fetal position on my bed and stayed there for a few minutes.Not because I couldn\u2019t afford to pay the $5,443 \u2014 I knew a number was coming in my direction, and so I had been stacking money in my checking account instead of trying to pay down my debt more quickly \u2014 but because there was another number in that email.That number was $1,000 per month, and it\u2019s the number my CPA recommends I set aside every month for 2015 taxes. $1,000 out of my $5,000 monthly income.Now, just to be clear, I think taxes are great. I\u2019m happy to pay my share. But sometimes you can get a number like that and think \u201cwow, that means I\u2019m going to have to spend the entire year staying in the same place.\u201d Metaphorically, in the \u201cI won\u2019t be able to build up my savings\u201d context, and literally. If I put $1,000 per month, or 20% of my pre-tax income, toward estimated taxes, I might not have enough money to move into a better apartment.The emphasis is on might, and I\u2019m going to spend some time this week figuring out what I actually can and can\u2019t afford. I\u2019m going to look at this budget again and figure out what changes when I put $1,000 in the \u201ctaxes\u201d column.I also know that these numbers don\u2019t really mean that I owe $5,443 on April 15; these numbers mean that I owe $8,443, because real tax and three months of estimated tax are due on the same day, which is come on, completely unfair. Stagger those dates by a month or so, feds! So I\u2019ll also be spending some time looking at when my invoices are likely to come due and whether I\u2019m going to pay the full 20% estimated tax burden on April 15 or, like my CPA suggested, pay a lower estimated tax now and catch up later.(You aren\u2019t penalized for underpayment of estimated taxes as long as you pay what would have been the previous year equivalent. So I could pay my 2015 estimated taxes as if I planned to earn what I did in 2014, even though I\u2019m guessing that I\u2019m going to earn much more than that, and make up the difference at some point before April 15, 2016. I\u2019m clearly not a tax professional, so talk to your own CPA if you\u2019re curious how something like that might apply to you.)This post originally appeared on The Billfold.Image: iStockMore from Credit.comHow Do Unpaid Taxes Affect Your Credit?\nHow to File Your Taxes for Free\nWhat's a Tax Lien?This article originally appeared on Credit.com.+ FollowFox Business on FacebookMore\u203aInvesting\u203a",

(AP Photo/Butch Dill)While a majority remains nervous about the economy these days, the number of voters feeling confident is growing.That\u2019s according to the latest Fox News poll released Wednesday.ADVERTISEMENTOver half of voters, 55 percent, are nervous about the economy. That\u2019s down from 65 percent who felt that way in 2013 and a high of 70 percent in 2010.CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTSAt the same time, the poll finds 39 percent of voters are feeling confident, up significantly from 28 percent two years ago (March 2013).Since 2013, confidence is up among both men (+ 6 points) and women (+ 14 points), as well as independents (+14 points), Democrats (+ 13 points) and Republicans (+ 6 points).Yet most Republicans still continue to have the jitters: 75 percent say so vs. 83 percent in 2013. Independents, by a wide margin, are also more likely to feel nervous than confident (60-33 percent).Sixty-one percent of Democrats are confident about the economy, while 35 percent say they are nervous.Education is also a strong predictor of feelings on the economy. Voters with a college degree (48 percent) are more likely than those without a degree (33 percent) to feel confident about the economy. White voters without a degree are even less likely to feel confident (27 percent).Improved perceptions of the economy boost President Obama\u2019s job ratings. Of the issues tested, he performs best on the economy: 45 percent of voters approve, while 52 percent disapprove. Last month it was 46-50 percent. His record low rating on the economy came in August 2011, when just 34 percent approved and 62 percent disapproved.Obama\u2019s next best issue is health care: 42 percent approve vs. 54 percent disapprove.His worst issues include Iran (33-58 percent), foreign policy (36-55 percent) and immigration (37-58 percent).As for Obama\u2019s overall performance, 45 percent of voters approve, while 50 percent disapprove. That\u2019s still underwater, but hardly his hull-scraping low of 38 percent approval in September 2014.The Fox News poll is conducted by telephone with live interviewers under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R).

    "Sign in to comment!File: May 22, 2013: Ex-IRS official Lois Lerner is sworn in on Capitol Hill, in Washington, D.C. (AP)The Justice Department has declined to pursue contempt of Congress charges against Lois Lerner for refusing to testify about her role at the IRS in the targeting of conservative groups.The department announced the decision in a letter Tuesday to House Speaker John Boehner, whose Republican-controlled chamber made the request to prosecute, after holding Lerner in contempt for refusing to at committee hearings.ADVERTISEMENT\"Once again, the Obama administration has tried to sweep IRS targeting of taxpayers for their political beliefs under the rug,\u201d Boehner spokesman Michael Steel told FoxNews.com.Lerner asserted her Fifth Amendment privilege, which allows people to not testify against themselves, during a May 2013 hearing of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and then again at a March 2014 hearing.However, House Republicans argued Lerner waived the privilege with an opening statement she made before the committee in the May 2013 appearance. All the chamber\u2019s Republican members and six Democrats officially voted in May 2014 to hold Lerner in contempt.Ron Machen Jr., the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said in the seven-page letter that federal prosecutors concluded Lerner did not waive her privilege because she made \u201conly general claims of innocence\u201d during the opening statement.\u201cThus, the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution would provide Ms. Lerner with an absolute defense should be prosecuted \u2026 for her refusal to testify,\u201d wrote Machen, who was appointed to the U.S. attorney post by President Obama and left for private practice Wednesday, one day after sending the letter.He also said he will not refer the case to a grand jury or take any other action to prosecute.Lerner ran the IRS\u2019s exempt organizations unit when Tea Party and other nonprofit groups with conservative names applying for tax-exempt status were targeted for additional auditing from April 2010 to April 2012.She was placed on administrative leave in May 2013 and retired four months later.\u201cI have not done anything wrong,\u201d Lerner said in her 2013 opening statement. \u201cI have not broken any laws. I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations. And I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee.\u201dThe IRS scandal broke in May 2013 when Lerner said at an American Bar Association gathering and during a follow-up conference call with reporters there was a \u201cvery big uptick\u201d in nonprofit applications and that the vetting process was limited to the agency\u2019s Cincinnati office.However, the extent to which the Obama administration knew about the targeting, beyond Lerner\u2019s unit in Washington, remains unclear in part because, she says, her computer crashed and emails were lost.Lerner attorney William Taylor said he and is client are \u201cgratified but not surprised\u201d by the decision by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\u201cAnyone who takes a serious and impartial look at this issue would conclude that Ms. Lerner did not waive her Fifth Amendment rights.\u201d he said. \u201cIt is unfortunate that the majority party in the House put politics before a citizen\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201dSteel also said the White House still has the opportunity to \u201cdo the right thing and appoint a special counsel to examine the IRS\u2019 actions.\"Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan said federal prosecutors made the \u201cwrong\u201d decision.\u201cAs one of his final acts as U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., Ronald Machen used his power as a political weapon to undermine the rule of law,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cMachen was legally bound to convene a grand jury, but instead he ignored his obligation and unilaterally decided to ignore the will of the House. \u2026 This is wrong, and a great example of why so many Americans distrust their government.\u201d45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

    "Sign in to comment!Are 'religious freedom' laws a done deal?Arkansas Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Wednesday urged state lawmakers to change a controversial religious freedom bill sent to his desk a day earlier, in the face of criticism that it could allow businesses and others to discriminate based on sexual orientation.Hutchinson had initially said he planned to sign the bill but backed off as his state, overnight, became the new focal point of a nationwide backlash over such legislation. Indiana for days has faced similar criticism for a related religious freedom bill.ADVERTISEMENTDuring a press conference in the state capital of Little Rock, Hutchinson said he wants to strike the \"right balance.\" The governor, amid calls by critics to veto the bill, made clear he still supports the intent of the legislation -- which prohibits state and local governments from infringing upon someone's religious beliefs without a compelling interest. But he said he wants changes made so it more closely mirrors a 1993 federal law.\"I asked that changes be made in the legislation,\" Hutchinson said, urging state lawmakers to \"recall\" the bill -- or pass additional legislation -- to \"remedy\" the issue.The announcement reflects the intense debate in state capitals across the country where such legislation is being considered. Backers say the intent was to simply replicate the 1993 federal law and similar laws in place in 19 other states. But when Indiana passed a slightly more expansive version which critics said could allow discrimination by businesses, Indiana lawmakers and Gov. Mike Pence later vowed to \"clarify\" the language in response to complaints.Hutchinson, too, said the country is clearly split on how to balance religious traditions with non-discrimination.At its heart, he said, \"this bill is not really complicated.\" But he cited a \"generational gap.\" As evidence, the governor said even his own son had signed a petition urging him to veto the bill.Hutchinson's chief complaint was that some provisions do not\" precisely mirror\" the federal law, and he wants that addressed. He said he's also working on an executive order to address the issue of tolerance.Echoing the reaction to Indiana's law, Hutchinson has faced pressure from the state's top employers, including retail giant Wal-Mart, which complained that the measure was discriminatory and would stifle economic development. Little Rock's mayor, the city's Chamber of Commerce and Arkansas-based data services company Acxiom all urged the governor to reject the measure in recent days.The Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights group, has run ads in Silicon Valley targeting technology firms Hutchinson hopes to attract to the state.Prior to the passage Tuesday of the Arkansas bill, the White House repeated its opposition to the Indiana law.\"This kind of public outcry ... is indicative of how this piece of legislation flies in the face of values that people all across America strongly support,\" said White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. \"Governor Pence falsely tried to suggest the law is the same as the 1993 law. That is not true.\"Earnest also said the Indiana law was a \"significant expansion\" of current law.The Associated Press contributed to this report.45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

    "Sign in to comment!By Dana BlantonThis undated file image provided by the U.S. Army shows Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. (AP Photo/U.S. Army, file)The United States did the wrong thing when it swapped five Taliban prisoners for a U.S. soldier named Bowe Bergdahl, say 47 percent of voters in a new Fox News poll. Some 36 percent think the U.S. did the right thing. Another nine percent think the U.S. should \u201cnever\u201d negotiate with terrorists.Bergdahl was held by the Taliban for five years after he reportedly walked away from his post in Afghanistan. He was charged by the U.S. military with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy March 25.ADVERTISEMENTCLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTSAlmost a year ago, in May 2014, the Obama administration released five Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Bergdahl\u2019s release. At that time, there were questions about how Bergdahl ended up in enemy hands, but no desertion charges had been filed. Voters then were more evenly split over the trade: 45 percent approved, while 47 percent disapproved (June 2014).Veterans and those currently serving in the military are more likely to say the administration did the wrong thing by releasing Gitmo prisoners for a soldier who had abandoned his post: 55 percent feel that way vs. 47 percent of voters overall.Fox News Channel\u2019s Chief Intelligence Correspondent Catherine Herridge reports that at least three of the five Taliban prisoners exchanged for Bergdahl have tried to reunite with their terrorist networks.Meanwhile, fear about an attack here at home is high: 84 percent of voters are concerned Islamic terrorists will try to launch an attack in the U.S. soon. That includes 51 percent who are \u201cvery\u201d concerned and another 33 percent who are \u201csomewhat\u201d concerned.At the same time, six in 10 voters (60 percent) think Obama is \u201cnot focused enough\u201d on the fight against Islamic extremists, including a 41-percent plurality of Democrats.Democrats (27 percent) are almost 10 times more likely than Republicans (3 percent) to say Obama is focusing the right amount of attention on fighting Islamic extremists.A 61-percent majority approves of President Obama\u2019s decision to delay withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and leave 9,800 troops there through year\u2019s end. That includes 65 percent of Democrats, 63 percent of Republicans and 66 percent of veterans.Currently 40 percent of voters approve of the job Obama is doing on terrorism, while 54 percent disapprove. That\u2019s up from a record-low 38 percent approval on terrorism in September 2014.The president\u2019s overall job approval rating stands at 45 percent, while 50 percent disapprove. That\u2019s up from 42-53 percent earlier this month (March 1-3, 2015). A year ago it was 40-53 percent (March 2014).PollpourriViews on air travel safety have turned more negative after a plane crash in the French Alps that investigators say was intentionally caused by the co-pilot.By a 29 percentage-point margin, more people think air travel is safer today than before 9/11. That\u2019s down from a 36-point margin last year (March 2014).Here are the details behind those numbers:The poll finds that despite significant coverage of the crash and the co-pilot\u2019s actions, 57 percent of American voters still say air travel is safer than it was before the September 11 terrorist attacks, down two percentage points from 59 percent last year (March 2014).At the same time, 28 percent think flying is less safe now. That\u2019s up five points from 23 percent in March 2014. For 11 percent of voters the safety of air travel is unchanged since before 9/11.The crash of the Germanwings jet on March 24 killed all 150 people on board. The co-pilot had apparently suffered from depression.The Fox News poll is conducted by telephone with live interviewers under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R). The 1,025 registered voters were reached via landline and cell phone numbers randomly selected for inclusion in this nationwide survey from March 29-31, 2015. The full poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved.

    "Sign in to comment!(FoxNews.com)If a sporty lime-green metallic coupe shown at the New York auto show is any indication, Honda isn't playing it safe with the Civic anymore.When the company last rolled out a new Civic four years ago, it took no risks. The car was panned for unremarkable looks and a cheap interior, with a chintzy plastic dashboard and bed-sheet thin seat fabric.ADVERTISEMENTThe next-generation Civic unveiled Wednesday has dramatic creases, a longer hood, 20-inch wheels and a big rear spoiler clearly designed to jettison the current car's dull appearance and handling.\"This, ladies and gentlemen, is the return of the sporty Civic,\" Executive Vice President John Mendel said at the car's introduction.Honda says the new car was redesigned top to bottom, with U.S. engineers and designers taking the lead. It's got single-line LED tail lights and a mean-looking front grille. The distance between the front and rear wheels is longer, and the car will get all-new engines and transmissions.Honda was short on details about the 10th-generation Civic. Executives did say higher-end versions will get a 1.5-Liter turbocharged engine, a first for Honda in the states. The Civic will debut in the fall with a sedan, followed later by the Coupe and an R-Type high performance version. A five-door hatchback and other unspecified variations are planned as well.Mendel said Honda is confident the new versions will attract people of all ages worldwide. The cars also will have refined handling as well as a spacious quiet interior, he said.The Civic will get new engines and transmissions, including a turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder motor in higher-end models, Honda said. It will have new six-speed manual or continuously variable transmissions.After the last Civic roll-out in 2011, critics said Honda cut costs to take profits at the wrong time \u2014 just as Ford, Chevrolet, Hyundai and others were coming out with improved compacts.As a result, Honda was forced to revamp the Civic in 2012 after just 19 months on the market in an effort to match the competition. The do-over gave the Civic a sportier profile, replaced its chintzy dashboard and seat fabric and made the ride quieter. The revamp came to market in about half the time it normally takes.The Civic's sales still grew in the past five years as U.S. auto sales returned to pre-recession levels, but the car was unable to gain any market share against the competition. The Civic's share has remained constant at 2.2 percent, according to Autodata Corp. Sales last year fell 3 percent to just under 326,000, but the Civic was still the second-best selling compact. Toyota's Corolla was first.Karl Brauer, senior analyst for Kelley Blue Book, said Honda had to discount the current Civic in order to keep sales going. The new version appears to do everything that Honda needs to do to regain leadership in the compact segment.\"I think they definitely knew that they had kind of lost their mojo in terms of a fun-to-drive stylish compact car, which had really been what had made the Civic so increasingly successful over the past 30 years,\" Brauer said.Mendel promised that the new version would be fun an exciting, true to the Civic's history.\"Everybody's upping the ante. We can up the ante too,\" he said. \"Taking this step will keep us ahead and hopefully drive some of that business back to Honda.\"",

    "Sign in to comment!Jimmy Walker, left, and Jordan Spieth talk on the 16th tee during the final round of the Valero Texas Open golf tournament, Sunday, March 29, 2015, in San Antonio. Walker won the tournament. (AP Photo/Darren Abate) (The Associated Press)HOUSTON \u2013  Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reid, Texas-born golfers and Ryder Cup partners, are part of a strong field at the Shell Houston Open with one eye toward next week.The 21-year-old Spieth and 24-year-old Reed have combined for eight wins around the world in the past three years. That doesn't include a major just yet, though they figure to have a reasonable chance at Augusta National next week.ADVERTISEMENTBoth are in good form.Three weeks ago, Spieth and Reed were part of a three-man playoff in the Valspar Championship that showed plenty of grit, clutch short-game shots and a determination not to lose until Spieth wound up winning with a 30-foot birdie putt.Spieth is coming off a runner-up finish in the Valero Texas Open that moved the Dallas native to No. 4 in the world.When asked Wednesday how he felt he was playing, Spieth said, \"Like a top-five player in the world.\"That phrase is often associated with Reed, who proclaimed himself just that when he won a World Golf Championship at Doral in 2014. Reed is No. 15 in the world and doesn't back down.Not from that comment at Doral. Not from the Ryder Cup crowd in Scotland. Not when he appeared to twice face impossible shots in the playoff with Spieth and Sean O'Hair only to answer with brilliance that kept him in the game.\"I don't regret anything I said,\" Reed said Wednesday. \"You have to believe in yourself. If you don't believe in yourself, no one else is going to.\"They are headliners at the Golf Club of Houston, which is about a half-hour from where Reed lives.The field is missing world No. 2 Henrik Stenson, who withdrew with an illness, and Texas Open winner Jimmy Walker, who took a scouting trip to Augusta National on Monday and withdrew because he wasn't feeling well.And while there is so much emphasis on the top players, the Houston Open is the final chance for someone to get into the Masters. The winner earns an invitation to Augusta if not already eligible. That fell last year to Matt Jones, who holed a long birdie putt on the 18th and then chipped in for birdie to beat Matt Kuchar in a playoff.Sergio Garcia is playing, and the 35-year-old Spaniard has something in common with Spieth and Reed. He hasn't won a major, either.Garcia was in their position a generation ago when he was 19 and pushed Tiger Woods to the very end at the 1999 PGA Championship. That was his first close call in a major and there have been others. But he still hasn't broken through.\"I think I've had a great career (even if) some people think the opposite,\" he said. \"I feel very fortunate. I've done some great things in and outside the golf course. I always give it my best effort. If someone plays better than you the only thing you can do is congratulate him and keep trying. (Winning a major) is important, but it's not the most important thing.\"The Houston field includes 45 foreign golfers representing a tournament-record 22 countries and 36 of the players here are next heading to the Masters.Jones is one of six former Houston champions teeing off Thursday, including 2011 winner Phil Mickelson. Mickelson is among the 14 winners of major championships entered.",
    "Let\u2019s talk about Chevron (CVX).We talked about it before, looking long term.

Long term, demand will be up over the next decades.

    "With April 15th fast approaching, what if you don\u2019t have the cash to pay your taxes? Should you consider delaying payment, or not filing taxes at all? The short answer is no \u2013 especially when it comes to failing to file your taxes on time.The IRS applies penalties for both failure-to-file and failure-to-pay, but failure-to-file penalties are much greater. That penalty is 5% of your unpaid taxes per month or any part of a month that the return is late, up to 25% of your total taxes owed. There is a minimum penalty of $135 or the balance of your tax bill, whichever is smaller. On top of that you will owe interest on the unpaid taxes, applied from the day after the payment due date (typically April 16th) to the date of payment. The interest rate varies with time, but in 2013 and the first quarter of 2014, it has been a constant 3%.The failure-to-pay penalty is much smaller, at \u00bd% per month, and may be reduced even further by setting up an installment payment plan, or otherwise working with the IRS. Contrary to the old stereotype, the IRS would rather work out a payment plan than slap you with penalties.It's easy to see how charges pile up. According to a 2012 analysis from Reuters via the H&R Block Tax Institute, if a taxpayer owes $2,000 and files a return in April but pays in June, the penalties and interest combined is approximately $43. On the other hand, if the same taxpayer doesn\u2019t file nor pay until June, the combined interest and penalties would total $314. Multiply that by larger amounts and/or longer times, and the effect is obvious.Can you get extensions on your filing date? Yes, under certain circumstances. However, getting an extension to file does not change the due date for any taxes you ultimately owe. You will need to at least get a decent estimate of the taxes you owe, and if you pay 90% of that by April 15th, you avoid a late payment penalty. Otherwise, you will still need to pay the \u00bd% per month penalty as well as the cumulative interest on the unpaid balance.If you are working or living abroad you can receive an automatic two-month extension to June 15th, but you must show proof with your filing that you were working or living abroad. There is a similar 180-day extension for military personnel in a combat zone. Otherwise, to get an extension you will need to fill out IRS Form 4868 and submit that prior to April 15th.Another method of extension is to pay all or part of your estimated tax by credit card or debit card using IRS-approved vendors (they will charge a fee) or the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System. Paying your anticipated taxes in this fashion triggers an automatic extension without having to file a Form 4868 (at least at this writing it does \u2013 check the IRS website for the most current details).Alternatively, you can argue reasonable cause for late filing with the IRS \u2013 assuming you have one. The bar is extremely high, requiring something like an incapacitating illness. It's best not to explore this path.The bottom line is that it's far better to contact the IRS and work out a solution than to simply ignore the filing date. There are multiple options available to you, and no excuse for not investigating them in detail to find the best solution for your situation.More From MoneyTips.com5 Key Steps in Preparing for April 15\nTop 12 Tax Deductions for the Self-Employed\nTax Refund Direct Deposit+ FollowFox Business on FacebookMore\u203aInvesting\u203a",

    "Sign in to comment!FILE: June 18, 2014: U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the Customs and Border Protection Nogales Placement Center in Nogales, Ariz. (AP)Senate Republicans are investigating allegations that federal managers retaliated against Border Patrol agents and other Homeland Security Department officials who refused to follow President Obama's immigration policies.The claims indicate a dispute inside federal immigration agencies over what exactly U.S. immigration law dictates, given the cascade of executive actions and guidance from the administration over the past several years. Allegedly, agents who don't want to follow the recent orders are being punished.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cWe are aware of multiple allegations of targeting and retaliation against DHS personnel who refuse to comply with this administration\u2019s willful disregard of our immigration laws,\u201d members of a Senate judiciary subcommittee on immigration told Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson in a letter on Tuesday.The letter, signed by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and others, noted the retaliation accusations have been included in lawsuits filed in federal court and aired in Capitol Hill testimony earlier this month.Chris Cabrera, a National Border Patrol Council (Local 3307) executive, recently told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that Border Patrol agents who repeatedly report a gathering of more than 20 illegal immigrants face retribution from managers. He said they're being taken out of the field and reassigned to processing detainees, and also assigned to low-volume areas as punishment.\u201cNeedless to say, agents got the message and now stay below this 20 person threshold no matter the actual size of the group,\u201d Cabrera testified.Even before Obama's recent executive actions, his administration has made a series of changes to immigration enforcement. In June 2012, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival gave a deportation reprieve -- and the option of seeking two-year work permits -- to some illegal immigrants who entered the United States before age 16 and before 2007. The administration also prioritized its enforcement resources to focus on deporting illegal immigrants who have committed felonies and others considered dangerous, while in some cases ignoring those with lower-level offenses.Obama expanded those programs in November 2014 through a series of executive actions. One allows parents of citizens and legal permanent residents to seek a deportation reprieve, and three-year work permits. Another expands the population eligible under DACA, and lengthens that work permit period from two to three years.Many Republicans and other critics of the administration\u2019s immigration policy have challenged the constitutionality of the measures.And in February, a federal judge in Texas placed a temporary hold on the 2014 actions, in a case in which 26 states are challenging their constitutionality.The Department of Homeland Security did not respond Wednesday to a request for comment.But agents facing the consequences for not enforcing changes should come as no surprise.Obama said in late February during a MSNBC/Telemundo town hall that Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Border Patrol officials ignoring the \u201cnew directives\u201d will have to answer to Johnson.\u201cHe\u2019s been very clear about what our priorities should be,\u201d the president said. \u201cIf somebody is working for ICE and there is a policy and they don\u2019t follow the policy, there are going to be consequences to it.\u201dThe subcommittee\u2019s letter argues the president\u2019s statements \u201cignore the plain language of several immigration statutes that command DHS personnel to take certain actions relating to illegal aliens, (and) the comments seem to comport with a pattern and practice of threats toward DHS personnel who seek to fulfill their duties under the law.\u201dThe letter also asks Johnson, in part, to provide by April 13 the number of employees the department has disciplined over the last six years, and provide statistics regarding the number of lawsuits or complaints filed by department personnel.The letter also was signed by Sens. Jeff Sessions; David Vitter, R-La.; David Perdue, R-Ga.; John Cornyn, R-Texas; Mike Lee, R-Utah; Ted Cruz, R-Texas; and Thom Tillis, R-N.C.45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

    "Sign in to comment!By Becky OskinThe newly found shape-shifting rain frog rests on a leaf. (Katherine Krynak)A fingernail-size frog that can morph its skin texture from spiny to smooth in just minutes is the first shape-shifting amphibian ever found, according to a new report.The tiny \"mutable rain frog\" (Pristimantis mutabilis) was discovered on the western slopes of Ecuador's Andes Mountains, in a protected cloud forest reserve. The misty, fog-enshrouded Choc\u00f3 cloud forest is a biodiversity hotspot, and the protected area, called Reserva Las Gralarias, is also home to several rare birds and butterflies. A new glass frog species, the Las Gralarias glass frog, was reported there in 2012.ADVERTISEMENTScientists from Cleveland's Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland Metroparks found the shape shifter during their annual survey of the reserve's amphibian population. For the past 10 years, Katherine Krynak, a biologist and Case Western graduate student, and Tim Krynak, a naturalist and Metroparks project manager, have walked the reserve trails together at night, listening for frog calls and scanning for rare species. [Photos: Cute and Colorful Frogs]The Krynaks volunteer their time and also support the reserve with a private nonprofit foundation.The pair first spotted the frog in 2006 and only snapped a photo, but later realized it could be a newfound species when they enlarged the image. They started calling the frog a \"punk rocker\" for its spiny-textured skin. \"It wasn't until we saw the amazing texture of its skin that we thought, 'wow, this is something different,'\" Katherine Krynak told Live Science.A female mutable rain frog is just 0.8 to 0.9 inches long, and males are even smaller, the new study reports. The rain frogs are a species-rich group that skips the tadpole stage and develops into frogs directly within their eggs.Lead study author Juan Guayasam\u00edn, a professor at the Universidad Tecnol\u00f3gica Indoam\u00e9rica in Ecuador, first suggested the little frog could be a new species, Krynak said. In 2009, the Krynaks finally saw another punk rocker frog and grabbed it for a detailed photo session, putting it in a small plastic cup overnight.But when Katherine Krynak opened the cup the next morning, the frog's spines were gone. Thinking she had nabbed the wrong frog, Krynak added moss to the cup to make the frog more comfortable until they could return it to the forest that night. \"We were both so disappointed because it had taken years to find another one,\" she said.But the Krynaks said they couldn't believe their eyes the next time they checked on the frog. Its spiny skin texture had returned. [In Photos: Animals That Mimic Plants]Tim Krynak documented the transition with a series of photos on a smooth white board, showing the frog transform from prickly to smooth in about five minutes.\"It was remarkable,\" Katherine Krynak said. \"We were both kind of in shock at this point.\"The Krynaks think the shape-shifting spines may provide camouflage in the mossy forests, but the idea still needs to be tested. Researchers also don't yet know how the frog morphs its skin from smooth to spiny, and then back again.However, Guayasam\u00edn has confirmed that P. mutabilis is a new and unique species through genetic tests and a description of the frog's body size, shape and color. Study co-author Carl Hutter, of the University of Kansas, also documented the frog's calls, identifying three songs that are different from other species.Double discoveryDuring the study, Hutter also discovered a relative of the punk rocker rain frog that can also change its skin texture. This previously known species, called Primates sobetes, has similar markings but is twice as large as the newly found rain frog.The shape-changing abilities of both frogs are reported March 24 in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society.The two shape-shifting frogs are in different groups, which suggests that the trait evolved independently or is present in more species than has been previously recognized, Krynak said.The discovery illustrates the importance of describing the behavior of new species, and bolsters the argument for preserving amphibian habitats, Katherine Krynak said. Amphibian populations are in decline around the world, and the Reserva Las Gralarias region is under threat from agriculture and cattle farming, she added.\"Amphibians are declining so rapidly that scientists are oftentimes describing new species from museum specimens because the animals have already gone extinct in the wild, and very recently,\" Katherine Krynak said.Copyright 2015 LiveScience, a Purch company.

    "Sign in to comment!Heir to Getty oil fortune found dead in LA home at age 47Andrew Getty, an heir to the Getty oil fortune, was found dead Tuesday afternoon at his home in the Hollywood Hills section of Los Angeles. He was 47.Los Angeles County coroner's Assistant Chief Ed Winter said that Getty's death appeared to be from natural causes, but had initially been called an accident because of medication found at the scene. He said coroner's officials need to await the results of further examination and toxicology tests, which could take up to 10 weeks to process.ADVERTISEMENT\"The tentative information that we do have is that he was not feeling good for the last couple months,\" Winter said, \"and he supposedly had an appointment tomorrow with a personal physician.\"Getty's parents, Ann and Gordon Getty, confirmed their son's death in a statement released late Tuesday. They asked that the media and public respect the family's privacy and said further statements would be issued as information becomes available.Police spokesman Jack Richter said that officers were called to Getty's home at around 2:15 p.m. local time Tuesday by an unidentified woman. Richter said a man's body was found in a bathroom of the house, and investigators interviewed the woman. LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith said the woman was cooperating with the investigation. Richter said she had not been placed under arrest.The Los Angeles Times reported that Getty had owned the home since 1996. The Times also reported, citing court records, that Getty sought a restraining order against a woman two weeks ago. It was not immediately clear if that woman was the same person who reported his death to police.Andrew Getty was one of four sons of Gordon Getty, a San Francisco multibillionaire who's considered one of the richest men in the United States, and a grandson of J. Paul Getty, who founded the Getty Oil Company and at one time was called the richest living American.J. Paul Getty was an avid collector of art and antiquities, and the Getty name is best known in the Los Angeles area for the museum that houses much of it, along with many other high-priced artworks bought since his death.Another Getty grandson, J. Paul Getty III, died in 2011 at age 54 after losing an ear in a grisly kidnapping in Rome when he was a teenager. The family reportedly stalled on paying a ransom, and the kidnappers cut off part of his ear, sending the severed organ to a newspaper to prove they had taken him captive.The oil heir, then 16, was freed after five months in captivity and a payment of $2.7 million.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Click for more from the Los Angeles Times.",

    "Sign in to comment!Iran nuclear talks extend beyond deadlineSecretary of State John Kerry is sticking around for at least another day of tense talks over Iran's nuclear program, pushing negotiations into double overtime -- even as other foreign ministers were sitting it out and the White House repeated a threat that all sides are \"prepared to walk away.\"\"We continue to make progress but have not reached a political understanding,\" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said in a brief statement, revealing that Kerry would once again postpone his departure from the Switzerland talks and \"remain in Lausanne until at least Thursday morning to continue the negotiations.\"ADVERTISEMENTNegotiators already had blown past a Tuesday at midnight deadline to push talks into Wednesday. It remained unclear whether talks continuing into Thursday could yield a deal framework.German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said negotiators were still facing a \"tough struggle,\" indicating the talks were not likely to end anytime soon. \"Tonight there will be new proposals, new recommendations. I can't predict whether that will sufficient to enable an agreement to be reached,\" he said.At the same time, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif accused his country's negotiating partners, particularly the U.S., of having \"defective\" political will in the talks.\"I've always said that an agreement and pressure do not go together, they are mutually exclusive,\" he told reporters. \"So our friends need to decide whether they want to be with Iran based on respect or whether they want to continue based on pressure.\"The foreign ministers of China, France and Russia previously had departed Lausanne Tuesday night. With talks bleeding into Thursday, France's foreign minister reportedly was on his way back.But patience may be wearing thin.White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday that talks were \"making some progress\" but that \"we have not yet received the specific, tangible commitments we and the international community require.\"And he restated a threat that the U.S. and others are prepared to leave the table.\"We're going to drive a hard bargain and we're going to expect Iran to make serious commitments,\" he said. \"And we're going to give them the opportunity to do so.  But if they don't, the international community, alongside the United States, is prepared to walk away and consider some alternatives.\"The Obama administration has faced recent calls to do just that.Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., told Fox News he's concerned the framework of a deal could allow Iran keep its uranium stockpiles and continue to enrich uranium in an underground bunker.\"You have to be willing to walk away from the table and to reapply leverage to Iran,\" Cotton said. \"And the fact that they're not willing to do that, that we're still sitting in Switzerland negotiating when three of our negotiating partners have already left just demonstrates to Iran that they can continue to demand dangerous concessions from the West.\"Speaking on MSNBC, former Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean seemed to agree. He said that while President Obama is \"right\" to seek a deal, it might be time to \"step away\" from the table and make clear that the U.S. is not backing off key positions -- including on Iran's uranium stockpile and the pace of sanctions relief.The negotiators' intention is to produce a joint statement outlining general political commitments to resolving concerns about the Iranians' nuclear program in exchange for relief of economic sanctions against Iran. In addition, they are trying to fashion other documents that would lay out in more detail the steps they must take by June 30 to meet those goals.But Iran has pushed back not only on the substance of the commitments the sides must make but to the form in which they will make them, demanding that it be a general statement with few specifics.  That is politically unpalatable for the Obama administration which must convince a hostile Congress that it has made progress in the talks so lawmakers do not enact new sanctions that could destroy the negotiations.Zarif said the result of this round of talks \"will not be more than a statement.\"A senior Western official pushed back on that, saying that nothing about a statement had been decided and that Iran's negotiating partners would not accept a document that contained no details. The official was not authorized to speak to the negotiations by name and spoke on condition of anonymity.Deputy Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi named differences on sanctions relief as one dispute -- but also suggested some softening of Tehran's long-term insistence that all sanctions on his country be lifted immediately once a final deal takes effect.He told Iranian TV that economic, financial, oil and bank sanctions imposed by the U.S., the European Union and others should be done away with as \"the first step of the deal.\"Alluding to separate U.N. sanctions he said a separate \"framework\" was needed for them.Negotiations have already been twice extended since an interim agreement between Iran, the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany was concluded in 2013. President Obama and other leaders, including Iran's, have said they are not interested in a third extension.But if the parties agree only to a broad framework that leaves key details unresolved, Obama can expect stiff opposition at home from members of Congress who want to move forward with new, stiffer Iran sanctions. Lawmakers had agreed to hold off on such a measure through March while the parties negotiated. The White House says new sanctions would scuttle further diplomatic efforts to contain Iran's nuclear work and possibly lead Israel to act on threats to use military force to accomplish that goal.The Associated Press contributed to this report.45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

    "Sign in to comment!Iraqi forces claim they have retaken most of TikritIraq's defense minister said security forces have achieved a \"magnificent victory\" over Islamic State fighters in Tikrit Wednesday, but a senior defense official told Fox News that the fighting is \u201cblock to block, especially in the northern part of Tikrit where ISIS still has fighters.\u201dKhalid al-Obeidi said Wednesday that security forces have \"accomplished their mission\" in the monthlong offensive to rid Saddam Hussein's hometown of the militant group.ADVERTISEMENT\"We have the pleasure, with all our pride, to announce the good news of a magnificent victory,\" Obeidi said in a video statement. \"Here we come to you, Anbar! Here we come to you, Nineveh, and we say it with full resolution, confidence, and persistence,\" naming other provinces under the sway of the extremists.Despite the claim, \u201cIraqi security forces are still fighting block to block in some cases, particularly in the northern part of Tikrit,\u201d a Pentagon official told Fox News. \u201cThis operation is still in the clearing stage.\u201dA spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition in the region told Fox News that the statement from Obeidi was \u201cprobably a little misleading,\u201d but added, \u201cwe are confident that Tikrit has been seized from ISIS.\u201dBoth officials said the coalition could not estimate how many militants are left in Tikrit, but described ISIS as \u201cscattered.\u201d\u201cThe fire is out, but some embers remain,\u201d said the spokesman for the Combined Joint Task Force.Militant mortar fire, which had been intense over previous days, fell silent Wednesday, with commanders saying only a few militant snipers remained in the city. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing operations.The U.S. launched airstrikes last week in support of Iraqi ground forces. The battle for Tikrit, 80 miles north of Baghdad, is seen as a key step toward eventually driving the militants out of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city.The road to Mosul extends another 150 miles to the north, and the Islamic State group still controls much of the vast Anbar province to the west.Iraqi forces, including soldiers, police officers, Shiite militias and Sunni tribes, launched a large-scale operation to recapture Tikrit on March 2. Last week, the United States launched airstrikes on the embattled city at the request of the Iraqi government.Tikrit is the hometown of Saddam Hussein, whose Sunni-dominated dictatorship ruled Iraq for more than two decades before it was toppled by the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. Since then the Sunni minority has felt increasingly marginalized by the Shiite majority and the Shiite-led government in Baghdad. In 2006, long-running tensions boiled over into sectarian violence that claimed tens of thousands of lives.The Islamic State was able to rally Sunni support by portraying its advance as a \"revolution\" against the Shiite-led government, and Tikrit fell in a matter of days last June as the security forces crumbled. Restoring security in the city will be a major test of the government's ability to stitch the country back together.The objective now, Interior Minister Mohammed Salem al-Ghabban said Wednesday, is to restore normalcy as quickly as possible.\"After clearing the area from roadside bombs and car bombs, we will reopen police stations to restore normalcy in the city, and we will form committees to supervise the return of people displaced from their homes,\" al-Ghabban said. He said the government will help displaced residents return and that a civil defense unit will be combing the city for roadside bombs and car bombs.\"Daesh is completely defeated,\" he added, using an Arabic name for the group.During a visit to Tikrit, Iraqi Prime Minsiter Haider al-Abadi said that military engineering units still need more time to clear the city from booby traps. He also waved an Iraqi flag in photos posted on his social media accounts.\"God's willing, there will be a fund to rebuild areas destroyed by Daesh and the war. Tikrit and Salahuddin areas will be covered by this fund,\" al-Abadi said.A satellite image of Tikrit, released in February by the United Nations, showed at least 536 buildings in the city have been affected by the fighting. Of those, at least 137 were completely destroyed and 241 were severely damaged. The current offensive also exacerbated previous damage, particularly in the south, where clashes have been the most intense in recent days.Iraq's parliament speaker, Salim al-Jabouri, called on the government to find the means to resettle residents from damaged Tikrit buildings. He said this \"requires effort and support by the central government in order to financially support the people in rebuilding their houses.\"Fox News\u2019 Lucas Tomlinson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",
    "Sign in to comment!By Walt BonnerThis undated photo provided by Thomas Chouvenc of the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (IFAS), shows young hybrid termite offspring eight months after the light-colored female Formosan termite, bottom right, mated with the darker male Asian termite, bottom left, in Florida. (AP Photo/Thomas Chouvenc, University of Florida/IFAS)Two of the world\u2019s most destructive termite species are swarming South Florida, and the fact that they are mating has scientists sweating.The Asian and Formosan subterranean termite species are producing hundreds of thousands of winged males and females (known as alates), which are in turn creating hybrid colonies, according to University of Florida entomologists. The two species are no joke, and hybrid colonies could prove even more disastrous for homeowners.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cThey are the two most destructive termite species in the world,\u201d University of Florida Entomology Professor Nan-Yao Su told FoxNews.com. \u201cThe common name for Formosan subterranean termite in China and Japan is \u2018house termite\u2019 as it can literally bring down a house, usually [starting] with [the] roof as they chew through the supporting beams.\u201dTermite colonies, sometimes consisting of millions of individuals, can live up to 20 years and thrive in South Florida, where the temperatures offer ideal mating conditions.Researchers previously believed that the two species had distinct swarming seasons that kept them apart, preventing the risk of interbreeding. However, they are now finding that there is an overlap in seasons in the south of the state, leading to the production of hybrid colonies.Apparently, the male Asian termites prefer Formosan females to that of their own species \u2013 a fact that, according to Professor Su, is due to pheromones. \u201cBoth species probably use [the] same chemical for mating,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the Formosan female probably produces more mating pheromone than [the] Asian subterranean termite female, hence the Formosan female becomes more attractive.  At least that is our working hypothesis.\u201dThe area of the species overlap extends from Miami (Dade County) to Riviera Beach (Palm Beach County).What makes the emergence of hybrid colonies so alarming is that they\u2019re reproducing at a rate that is more than twice as fast as the parent species. Known as \u201chybrid vigor,\u201d this offers a few troubling scenarios: that the hybrid colonies could reach maturity faster (two to three years, as opposed to the parent species maturing in five to six), or that they could form a much larger colony (5 million to 10 million termites per colony, as opposed to 2 million to 5 million).Either way, Su said, it\u2019s bad news: \u201cWe don\u2019t know if the hybrid individual can consume more wood, but these are parameters we need to study.  At any rate, any of one of these, if proven correct, could mean more destructive termites.\u201dThis doesn\u2019t only spell trouble for South Floridians. With the hybrid colonies reproducing at a much faster rate and growing to larger numbers, the possibility of them spreading to other states is that much greater.According to Su, this will depend on the hybrid\u2019s fertility. \u201cDue to its tropical distribution, Asian subterranean termites probably won\u2019t go any further than Palm Beach County.  If the hybrid offspring is sterile, then the hybrid population will most likely [be] restricted to South Florida.  However, if the hybrid offspring is NOT sterile, and it has the temperature tolerance of both parent species, then we may see them expanding from North Carolina to Brazil.\u201dThe Asian and Formosan termites are no strangers to world travel. The Formosan termite originated in China, but is now firmly entrenched in the southeastern U.S. Even more widespread are the Asian termites, which have managed to spread to Brazil and the Caribbean islands. The species invade foreign soil by hitching rides on wooden boats or by stowing away in shipped wooden crates.Currently, homeowners can use baits or apply insecticides in the dirt surrounding their houses to halt or prevent infestation. With the emergence of these new hybrid colonies, it may be time to stock up.",

    "Sign in to comment!Sen. Robert Menendez responds to federal indictmentA defiant N.J. Sen. Robert Menendez vowed Wednesday to fight corruption charges against him, hours after a federal grand jury handed up an indictment that accused the two-term Democrat of using his office to help a party donor.\u201cI am not going anywhere,\u201d Menendez said at an evening press conference in Newark. \u201cThis is not how my career is going to end.\u201dADVERTISEMENTMenendez, a powerful political force in New Jersey and a leading skeptic of the Obama administration\u2019s Cuba and Iran policies, was indicted on 14 counts, including conspiracy to commit bribery and wire fraud. He\u2019s accused of using his office to improperly benefit a political donor who allegedly offered the senator an array of perks, including trips on his private jet and access to an exclusive Dominican resort.The 61-year-old senator Wednesday night blasted what he called \u201cfalse allegations,\u201d which he said were being perpetuated \u201cby those who have a political motivation to silence me.\u201d\u201cBut I will not be silenced,\u201d he vowed. \u201cI\u2019m confident at the end of the day I will be vindicated and they will be exposed.\u201dThe Newark grand jury has been investigating Menendez for official actions he took on behalf of his friend Dr. Salomon Melgen. Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist, was also indicted Wednesday.The indictment, which comes as the U.S. and other world powers are struggling to strike a nuclear agreement with Iran, is a blow at a critical time to Menendez, who is the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and until recently was chairman. A person familiar with the matter confirmed to Fox News that Menendez will step down from his post and is \u201cdoing so temporarily and voluntarily.\u201dMenendez has acknowledged that he flew multiple times on Melgen\u2019s private jet to the Dominican Republic and initially failed to properly pay for the trips. In 2013, Menendez agreed to reimburse Melgen $58,500 for the full cost of two flights.The senator\u2019s office later disclosed another flight from Florida to New Jersey in 2011, and said Menendez had repaid Melgen $11,250 for it.Last year, Menendez disclosed that his campaign accounts had paid a law firm $250,000 for legal costs related to investigations by the Justice Department and the Senate Ethics Committee of his ties to Melgen.Menendez has also acknowledged taking actions that could benefit Melgen, among them contacting U.S. health agencies to ask about billing practices and policies.But the lawmaker has said he did nothing wrong and that he and Melgen have been friends for decades.\"We celebrated holidays together,\" he once told reporters. \"We have been there for family weddings and sad times like funerals and have given each other birthday, holiday and wedding presents, just as friends do.\"The indictment against Menendez also accuses the senator of accepting nearly $1 million worth of gifts between January 2006 and January 2013 as well as using the power of his Senate office to influence the outcome of \u201congoing contractual and Medicare billing disputes worth tens of millions of dollars to Melgen and to support the visa applications of several of Melgen\u2019s girlfriends.\u201dIn one incident, \u201cGirlfriend 3,\u201d a Ukrainian national who worked as a model and actress living in Spain at the time, was denied a tourist visa to visit Melgen in Miami. On Feb. 15, 2007, Menendez staffers wrote a letter to the consul general asking a non-immigrant visa for his friend.The indictment also claims Menendez stayed in an executive suite at the five-star Park Hyatt- Paris-Vendome on April 8, 2010 through April 11, 2010. The hotel stay was valued at $4,934.10. The government says Menendez solicited and accepted 649,611 American Express Membership Rewards points from Melgen to foot the bill. The government says Menendez asked his office manager to research Park Hyatt rates, and check to see if a government rate was available.Federal investigators also point to emails between him and former Chief Counsel, Kerru Talbot and a staffer with Customs and Border Patrol in \u200ewhich Talbot asked CBP not to donate screening equipment to the Dominican Republic, but instead to allow a private contractor controlled by Melgen to provide that equipment.Melgen came under renewed scrutiny when government data last year showed he had received more in Medicare reimbursements in 2012 than any other doctor in the country.Menendez becomes the first sitting U.S. senator to face indictment since then-Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, in 2008. Stevens was found guilty of concealing gifts from donors on financial disclosure statements, but the Justice Department later dropped the case after admitting that prosecutors failed to turn over evidence that would have been favorable to his defense.\"Senator Menendez\u2019s ethics lapses have long been a distraction to the United States Senate,\u201d Andrea Bozek, a spokeswoman with the National Republican Senatorial Committee said in a written statement. \u201cWith today's indictment, the FBI and the Justice Department made it clear that Senator Menendez has betrayed the trust of New Jersey families. His actions reinforce all that the American people believe is wrong with Washington Democrats and closes the book on a Senate Democrat majority that put their personal interests ahead of the American people.\"Menedez joined the Senate in 2006 after serving more than a decade in the House of Representatives.A lawyer and former mayor of Union City, New Jersey, Menendez also served in the New Jersey General Assembly and state Senate.Fox News' Jake Gibson, Kara Rowland, Nicole Busch and The Associated Press contributed to this report.45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

With talks bleeding into Thursday, France's foreign minister reportedly was on his way back.But patience may be wearing thin.White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday that talks were \"making some progress\" but that \"we have not yet received the specific, tangible commitments we and the international community require.\"And he restated a threat that the U.S. and others are prepared to leave the table.\"We're going to drive a hard bargain and we're going to expect Iran to make serious commitments,\" he said. \"And we're going to give them the opportunity to do so.  But if they don't, the international community, alongside the United States, is prepared to walk away and consider some alternatives.\"The Obama administration has faced recent calls to do just that.Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., told Fox News he's concerned the framework of a deal could allow Iran keep its uranium stockpiles and continue to enrich uranium in an underground bunker.\"You have to be willing to walk away from the table and to reapply leverage to Iran,\" Cotton said. \"And the fact that they're not willing to do that, that we're still sitting in Switzerland negotiating when three of our negotiating partners have already left just demonstrates to Iran that they can continue to demand dangerous concessions from the West.\"Speaking on MSNBC, former Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean seemed to agree. He said that while President Obama is \"right\" to seek a deal, it might be time to \"step away\" from the table and make clear that the U.S. is not backing off key positions -- including on Iran's uranium stockpile and the pace of sanctions relief.The negotiators' intention is to produce a joint statement outlining general political commitments to resolving concerns about the Iranians' nuclear program in exchange for relief of economic sanctions against Iran. In addition, they are trying to fashion other documents that would lay out in more detail the steps they must take by June 30 to meet those goals.But Iran has pushed back not only on the substance of the commitments the sides must make but to the form in which they will make them, demanding that it be a general statement with few specifics.  That is politically unpalatable for the Obama administration which must convince a hostile Congress that it has made progress in the talks so lawmakers do not enact new sanctions that could destroy the negotiations.Zarif said the result of this round of talks \"will not be more than a statement.\"A senior Western official pushed back on that, saying that nothing about a statement had been decided and that Iran's negotiating partners would not accept a document that contained no details. The official was not authorized to speak to the negotiations by name and spoke on condition of anonymity.Deputy Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi named differences on sanctions relief as one dispute -- but also suggested some softening of Tehran's long-term insistence that all sanctions on his country be lifted immediately once a final deal takes effect.He told Iranian TV that economic, financial, oil and bank sanctions imposed by the U.S., the European Union and others should be done away with as \"the first step of the deal.\"Alluding to separate U.N. sanctions he said a separate \"framework\" was needed for them.Negotiations have already been twice extended since an interim agreement between Iran, the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany was concluded in 2013. President Obama and other leaders, including Iran's, have said they are not interested in a third extension.But if the parties agree only to a broad framework that leaves key details unresolved, Obama can expect stiff opposition at home from members of Congress who want to move forward with new, stiffer Iran sanctions. Lawmakers had agreed to hold off on such a measure through March while the parties negotiated. The White House says new sanctions would scuttle further diplomatic efforts to contain Iran's nuclear work and possibly lead Israel to act on threats to use military force to accomplish that goal.The Associated Press contributed to this report.45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

    "Sign in to comment!By K.T. McFarlandPresident Obama speaks at dedication of the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate in Boston, Monday, March 30, 2015. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry are negotiating an agreement with Iran that will accelerate a nuclear arms race in a part of the world that has begun a 30-year, fight to the finish, religious war.  It is a prescription for disaster.The administration won\u2019t portray it that way, of course.  They will say they have succeeded in slowing down Iran\u2019s program.  They will offer the usual Obama straw man argument -- it\u2019s a choice between this deal and war with Iran.  And nobody wants another war in the Middle East.ADVERTISEMENTYet some neo-Conservatives have called for just that:  they say the only way to stop Iran\u2019s bomb is to bomb Iran.  But these are the same folks who said the Iraq war would be short, sweet and cheap.They\u2019re both wrong.  The choice is not between capitulation and war.  Foreign policy is what\u2019s conducted between these two extremes.  Our policy shouldn\u2019t be either let Iran get the bomb or bomb Iran.  We should do something different, in the middle.  We should do what Ronald Reagan did with the Soviet Union. He didn\u2019t accept Soviet aggression, but he didn\u2019t want to go to war with them either. Reagan maneuvered events so the people of the Soviet Union demanded regime change.Our policy toward Iran should not be Obama-style capitulation, or Bush-style war, but Reagan-style regime change, where we push their economy to the brink and Iranian people rise up and demand change.We have enormous leverage to bring against Iran, if we chose to.  We could push for a better deal by imposing punitive sanctions. We could freeze them out of the world banking system.  We could tighten the economic noose around Iran\u2019s neck. We could encourage the pro-American, pro-democracy movement in Iran to challenge the mullahs.  We could tear down Iran\u2019s cyberwall, so their young and literate population can see what the rest of the world is like and launch a social media driven revolution of their own. More than 70 percent of Iranians are under the age of 30.  How long will they tolerate being ruled by a handful of 80-year-old mullahs who have pushed their economy into freefall?  The Iranian people took to the streets in 2009 to demand government change, but President Obama turned his back on them.  Could we encourage them this time?Two years ago the administration set out to get a deal that would have been a good one: We lift sanctions and welcome Iran into the world economy and Iran dismantles its nuclear weapons program. They get to keep their nuclear energy program, just not their nuclear weapons program.  A Middle East nuclear arms race never starts.Right now the administration claims it is \u201cnegotiating\u201d the final strokes of an agreement, but Iran is holding out for even more concessions. Secretary Kerry shouldn\u2019t just walk away from these negotiations, he should run away.At this point, the final details aren\u2019t that important -- the U.S. has already conceded that Iran doesn\u2019t have to dismantle its nuclear weapons program, it just has to unplug part of it -- for a while -- with inadequate inspection . . . and no penalties if they plug it back in.It\u2019s like resting world peace on a pinky-swear while Iran has its fingers crossed behind its back. Obama and Kerry got played, fittingly, on April Fool\u2019s Day.President Obama may be convinced his deal with Iran will stop their nuclear weapons program, but no one else does, especially not Iran\u2019s neighbors.  They see this as the United States leaving the region and leaving an economically, politically and militarily powerful nuclear Iran in charge.  Many have already announced they will acquire their own nuclear weapons.  Some think Iran\u2019s archenemy, Saudi Arabia, already has a few nukes on order from Pakistan.  After that, it\u2019s a nuclear arms race with the world\u2019s most dangerous weapons in the hands of fanatics who shouldn\u2019t even be allowed to play with matches.So in a region now wracked by regional civil war between Iranian Shiites and Arab Sunnis, if Iran gets nukes, the Arab states get nukes.  From there it is a small step to envision weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of radical Islamic extremists.  And that\u2019s the ultimate nightmare scenario:  nuclear weapons in the hands of extremists who would be willing to die as long as they can also kill their enemies.From the dawn of the atomic age, the nightmare scenario has been nuclear weapons in the hands of people who would be eager to use them.  The way we kept superpower peace throughout the atomic age was through deterrence. There were never effective defenses against nuclear weapons, but the United States and USSR had survivable nuclear weapons they would use in retaliation.  Each side knew if they launched a nuclear attack, they were guaranteed a nuclear attack in return.  It was called Mutually Assured Destruction, or M.A.D., and it was a mutual suicide pact.  It was an uneasy peace, but it kept the peace.But we\u2019ve entered a new era.  Deterrence doesn\u2019t work on suicide bombers or radical jihadists eager to usher in the end of days.  If the administration is willing to let Iran get nuclear weapons, then at least try to change the Iranian regime from one chanting \u201cDeath to America\u201d and exporting terrorism throughout the world, to one willing to live at peace with its neighbors.Or is the President so eager for a foreign policy success to finish out his time in office that he\u2019s willing to dismiss this as mere \u201crhetoric,\u201d  and succumb to a form of willful blindness? If so,  Obama may get his Tehran summit, and the liberal media will cheer him along, but not for long.  President Obama\u2019s great legacy won\u2019t be Nixon to China, but Neville Chamberlain at Munich.Kathleen Troia \"K.T.\" McFarland is a Fox News National Security Analyst and host of FoxNews.com's \"DefCon 3.\" She served in national security posts in the Nixon, Ford and Reagan administrations.

    "Sign in to comment!Jan. 14, 2015: Spectators gaze at El Capitan, as seen from the valley floor in Yosemite National Park, Calif. (AP)Be prepared to pay a bit more if you're headed to some national parks and recreation areas this summer.After a six-year moratorium, the federal government is increasing the price of admission at some of its public lands and raising the fees charged for camping, boating, cave tours and other activities. The National Park Service says the money expected to be raised is just a fraction of the $11.5 billion needed to repair and maintain roads, trails and park buildings.ADVERTISEMENTSome members of Congress have expressed concern about the fee increases, but National Park Service Director Jonathan Jarvis said at a March congressional hearing that visitors are still getting an incredible deal when compared to other recreational pursuits.\"We cannot greet them with failing facilities,\" Jarvis said of the 295 million people expected to visit National Park Service properties, which also include sites like the Lincoln Memorial.Fees have increased in eight parks, including Yosemite, so far and are likely to rise in several dozen more parks in the coming months.Each park determines how much to charge visitors after public input and approval from Washington. Jarvis told park superintendents last September to begin the public outreach that must accompany fee increases. The service went to Facebook as part of its efforts to gauge the prospect of higher fees at Yosemite National Park.\"Keep in mind -- this belongs to the people, and it shouldn't be priced out of the reach of the average person,\" wrote Gayle Partmann of Rohnert Park, California. Partmann and her family spent several summer vacations at Yosemite when she was growing up.Examples of proposed or enacted fee increases by The National Park Service:-- Increasing the annual pass at Everglades National Park in Florida from $25 to $40 annually.-- Increasing the weekly car pass at Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona from $25 to $30.-- Increasing the price of cave tours between $1 and $5 at Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky.-- Increasing the annual pass at Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado from $40 to $60 annually.-- Increasing the weekly car pass at Theodore Roosevelt National Park in western North Dakota from $10 to $20, and eventually to $25.-- Increasing the weekly car pass at Yosemite National Park in California from $20 to $25 or $30, depending on the season.\"I'd rather pay money to get into Yosemite than any theme park I've been to,\" wrote William Sanger of Berwick, Maine, who visited the park in October.Only about a third of the 400-plus properties within the National Park Service system charge an entrance fee. Even in those places that do charge a fee, many visitors are exempted. For example, federal law requires parks to issue free passes for the disabled and to provide the elderly with the option of buying a lifetime pass for just $10.Families can also buy an $80 annual pass that allows them to go to as many national parks as they desire, and that price will remain the same.By comparison, the cost of going to Disneyland for a day is a minimum of $99 for one person age 10 and over.Fees vary from park to park. At Yosemite National Park, the country's third-busiest national park last year, the annual pass increased from $40 to $60.Nick Haris, a motorcyclist who lives about two hours from Yosemite and travels there regularly, said the price increases are unlikely to deter him from coming back, but he's heard grumbling from other motorcyclists.Haris said area motorcyclists generally just want to ensure they're not singled out for steeper increases than other park visitors. The National Park Service helped alleviate some of those concerns by phasing in the increase and not charging as much as originally proposed. The rate per motorcycle has risen from $10 to $15 this year and will jump to $20 next year.\"I think it's worth it,\" Haris said.Jarvis said the National Park Service collects about $180 million annually through fees and had hoped to raise $45 million more through all the fee increases. But officials have delayed or rescinded some proposed increases based on opposition from local residents and lawmakers.The agency's needs are numerous. Half of all paved roads in the national park system have been designated as in fair to poor condition. More than two dozen bridges need repair, as do more than one-third of the hiking trails -- some 6,700 miles, according to the agency.Some Republican lawmakers have questioned the scale of the pending fee increases. Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa, whose Northern California district includes Lassen Volcanic National Park, said the cost of \"just driving through the park\" is possibly jumping from $10 to $25 per vehicle, while hikers and bikers would see fees go up from $5 to $12 a person, and motorcyclists could see an increase from $5 to $20.He said a modest increase, perhaps 25 percent, could be understandable. But going beyond that \"really starts making a difference in people's pocketbooks,\" LaMalfa said.45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved.

    "Sign in to comment!By Alana GoodmanHillary Clinton's chief of staff at the State Department was listed as a director at the Clinton Foundation in its corporate records for more than three years after joining the administration, highlighting concerns that Clinton's aides were too close to the foundation during her tenure.The \"William J. Clinton Foundation Corporation\" named Cheryl Mills as one its three directors when it applied for nonprofit corporate status in Florida in June 2009-five months after Mills began serving as Clinton's chief of staff and counsel at the State Department.ADVERTISEMENTThe organization continued to list Mills as a director in its annual state filings in 2010, 2011, and 2012. During this time, the foundation updated its office address and registered agent on the same documents. Chelsea Clinton replaced Mills in the March 2013 report.The Florida filings highlight the cozy relationship between Clinton's inner circle at the State Department and the Clinton Foundation, which has come under scrutiny from watchdog groups for accepting money from foreign governments and donors.Huma Abedin, another close Clinton aide, received a waiver in 2012 that allowed her to do part-time consulting for the foundation while working for the government. She did not publicly acknowledge the work until it was revealed by the New York Times.Earlier this month, the conservative group Citizens United sued the State Department to release emails between Mills and Clinton Foundation officials.Click for more from The Washington Free Beacon.45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

    "Sign in to comment!Iraq's defense minister said security forces have achieved a \"magnificent victory\" over Islamic State fighters in Tikrit Wednesday, but a senior defense official told Fox News that the fighting is \u201cblock to block, especially in the northern part of Tikrit where ISIS still has fighters.\u201dKhalid al-Obeidi said Wednesday that security forces have \"accomplished their mission\" in the monthlong offensive to rid Saddam Hussein's hometown of the militant group.ADVERTISEMENT\"We have the pleasure, with all our pride, to announce the good news of a magnificent victory,\" Obeidi said in a video statement. \"Here we come to you, Anbar! Here we come to you, Nineveh, and we say it with full resolution, confidence, and persistence,\" naming other provinces under the sway of the extremists.Despite the claim, \u201cIraqi security forces are still fighting block to block in some cases, particularly in the northern part of Tikrit,\u201d a Pentagon official told Fox News. \u201cThis operation is still in the clearing stage.\u201dA spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition in the region told Fox News that the statement from Obeidi was \u201cprobably a little misleading,\u201d but added, \u201cwe are confident that Tikrit has been seized from ISIS.\u201dBoth officials said the coalition could not estimate how many militants are left in Tikrit, but described ISIS as \u201cscattered.\u201d\u201cThe fire is out, but some embers remain,\u201d said the spokesman for the Combined Joint Task Force.Militant mortar fire, which had been intense over previous days, fell silent Wednesday, with commanders saying only a few militant snipers remained in the city. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing operations.The U.S. launched airstrikes last week in support of Iraqi ground forces. The battle for Tikrit, 80 miles north of Baghdad, is seen as a key step toward eventually driving the militants out of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city.The road to Mosul extends another 150 miles to the north, and the Islamic State group still controls much of the vast Anbar province to the west.Iraqi forces, including soldiers, police officers, Shiite militias and Sunni tribes, launched a large-scale operation to recapture Tikrit on March 2. Last week, the United States launched airstrikes on the embattled city at the request of the Iraqi government.Tikrit is the hometown of Saddam Hussein, whose Sunni-dominated dictatorship ruled Iraq for more than two decades before it was toppled by the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. Since then the Sunni minority has felt increasingly marginalized by the Shiite majority and the Shiite-led government in Baghdad. In 2006, long-running tensions boiled over into sectarian violence that claimed tens of thousands of lives.The Islamic State was able to rally Sunni support by portraying its advance as a \"revolution\" against the Shiite-led government, and Tikrit fell in a matter of days last June as the security forces crumbled. Restoring security in the city will be a major test of the government's ability to stitch the country back together.The objective now, Interior Minister Mohammed Salem al-Ghabban said Wednesday, is to restore normalcy as quickly as possible.\"After clearing the area from roadside bombs and car bombs, we will reopen police stations to restore normalcy in the city, and we will form committees to supervise the return of people displaced from their homes,\" al-Ghabban said. He said the government will help displaced residents return and that a civil defense unit will be combing the city for roadside bombs and car bombs.\"Daesh is completely defeated,\" he added, using an Arabic name for the group.During a visit to Tikrit, Iraqi Prime Minsiter Haider al-Abadi said that military engineering units still need more time to clear the city from booby traps. He also waved an Iraqi flag in photos posted on his social media accounts.\"God's willing, there will be a fund to rebuild areas destroyed by Daesh and the war. Tikrit and Salahuddin areas will be covered by this fund,\" al-Abadi said.A satellite image of Tikrit, released in February by the United Nations, showed at least 536 buildings in the city have been affected by the fighting. Of those, at least 137 were completely destroyed and 241 were severely damaged. The current offensive also exacerbated previous damage, particularly in the south, where clashes have been the most intense in recent days.Iraq's parliament speaker, Salim al-Jabouri, called on the government to find the means to resettle residents from damaged Tikrit buildings. He said this \"requires effort and support by the central government in order to financially support the people in rebuilding their houses.\"Fox News\u2019 Lucas Tomlinson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

    "Sign in to comment!March 31, 2015: In this photo taken and provided by the French Interior Ministry, French emergency rescue services work among debris of the Germanwings passenger jet at the crash site near Seyne-les-Alpes, France. (AP/Ministere de l'Interieur)Questions swirled Wednesday over a video reportedly taken by someone inside the cabin of the doomed Germanwings plane shortly before it crashed -- a video that reporters for two publications say was found on a memory chip that could have come from a passenger's cellphone.Marseille Prosecutor Brice Robin, who is overseeing the French criminal investigation into the crash, told The Associated Press that investigators had found no such video. But in a statement Wednesday, he left open the possibility that such video had been found but not given to authorities.ADVERTISEMENT\"In the hypothesis that someone is in possession of such a video, he or she should submit it immediately to investigators,\" he said.The controversy came as Lufthansa's chief executive said Wednesday it will take \"a long, long time\" to understand what led to a deadly crash in the French Alps last week -- but refused to say exactly what the airline knew about the mental health of the co-pilot suspected of deliberately destroying the plane.Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr and the head of Germanwings, it's low-cost subsidiary, Thomas Winkelmann, visited the crash area amid mounting questions about how much the airlines knew about co-pilot Andreas Lubitz's psychological state and why they haven't released more information about it.The two men laid flowers and then stood silently facing a stone monument to the plane's 150 victims that looks toward the French mountains where Germanwings Flight 9525 shattered into thousands of pieces on March 24. It bears a memorial message in German, Spanish, French and English.Spohr said the airline is \"learning more every day\" about what might have led to the crash but \"it will take a long, long time to understand how this could happen.\"He then deflected questions from reporters at the site in Seyne-les-Alpes and drove away.Based on audio from the plane's voice data recorder, investigators believe Lubitz intentionally crashed the plane and are trying to figure out why.Lufthansa acknowledged Tuesday that it knew six years ago that Lubitz had suffered from an episode of \"severe depression\" before he finished his flight training at the German airline, but said he had passed all his medical checks since then.The airline did not mention the severe depression episode when questions were raised last week about Lubitz's medical history.German prosecutors say Lubitz's medical records from before he received his pilot's license referred to \"suicidal tendencies,\" but visits to doctors since then showed no record of any suicidal tendencies or aggression against others.The revelations intensify questions about how much Lufthansa and its insurers will pay in damages for the passengers who died -- and about how thoroughly the aviation industry and government regulators screen pilots for psychological problems.Germany's Transport Ministry said Wednesday there are already checks in place for employees in security-sensitive jobs, including pilots. However, spokeswoman Vera Moosmayer said someone who in the past suffered from severe depression could become a pilot if he or she passes the relevant medical.\"We will wait and collect the insights that coming out of this terrible tragedy, and then decide whether changes need to be made,\" Moosmayer told reporters in Berlin.At the crash site Wednesday, authorities said investigators have finished collecting human remains. Lt. Luc Poussel said all that's left are \"belongings and pieces of metal.\"Officials at France's national criminal laboratory near Paris say it will take a few months for the painstaking identification process to be complete and for the remains to be returned to the families.New images of the recovery operation released by the Interior Ministry showed investigators tugging out large, mangled pieces of the plane: tires, sections with several twisted windows and what looked like a piece of the orange-painted tail.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

(AP/Ministere de l'Interieur)Questions swirled Wednesday over a video reportedly taken by someone inside the cabin of the doomed Germanwings plane shortly before it crashed -- a video that reporters for two publications say was found on a memory chip that could have come from a passenger's cellphone.Marseille Prosecutor Brice Robin, who is overseeing the French criminal investigation into the crash, told The Associated Press that investigators had found no such video. But in a statement Wednesday, he left open the possibility that such video had been found but not given to authorities.ADVERTISEMENT\"In the hypothesis that someone is in possession of such a video, he or she should submit it immediately to investigators,\" he said.The controversy came as Lufthansa's chief executive said Wednesday it will take \"a long, long time\" to understand what led to a deadly crash in the French Alps last week -- but refused to say exactly what the airline knew about the mental health of the co-pilot suspected of deliberately destroying the plane.Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr and the head of Germanwings, it's low-cost subsidiary, Thomas Winkelmann, visited the crash area amid mounting questions about how much the airlines knew about co-pilot Andreas Lubitz's psychological state and why they haven't released more information about it.The two men laid flowers and then stood silently facing a stone monument to the plane's 150 victims that looks toward the French mountains where Germanwings Flight 9525 shattered into thousands of pieces on March 24. It bears a memorial message in German, Spanish, French and English.Spohr said the airline is \"learning more every day\" about what might have led to the crash but \"it will take a long, long time to understand how this could happen.\"He then deflected questions from reporters at the site in Seyne-les-Alpes and drove away.Based on audio from the plane's voice data recorder, investigators believe Lubitz intentionally crashed the plane and are trying to figure out why.Lufthansa acknowledged Tuesday that it knew six years ago that Lubitz had suffered from an episode of \"severe depression\" before he finished his flight training at the German airline, but said he had passed all his medical checks since then.The airline did not mention the severe depression episode when questions were raised last week about Lubitz's medical history.German prosecutors say Lubitz's medical records from before he received his pilot's license referred to \"suicidal tendencies,\" but visits to doctors since then showed no record of any suicidal tendencies or aggression against others.The revelations intensify questions about how much Lufthansa and its insurers will pay in damages for the passengers who died -- and about how thoroughly the aviation industry and government regulators screen pilots for psychological problems.Germany's Transport Ministry said Wednesday there are already checks in place for employees in security-sensitive jobs, including pilots. However, spokeswoman Vera Moosmayer said someone who in the past suffered from severe depression could become a pilot if he or she passes the relevant medical.\"We will wait and collect the insights that coming out of this terrible tragedy, and then decide whether changes need to be made,\" Moosmayer told reporters in Berlin.At the crash site Wednesday, authorities said investigators have finished collecting human remains. Lt. Luc Poussel said all that's left are \"belongings and pieces of metal.\"Officials at France's national criminal laboratory near Paris say it will take a few months for the painstaking identification process to be complete and for the remains to be returned to the families.New images of the recovery operation released by the Interior Ministry showed investigators tugging out large, mangled pieces of the plane: tires, sections with several twisted windows and what looked like a piece of the orange-painted tail.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

(AP)WASHINGTON \u2013  Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are pushing back on proposed dietary guidelines they say wrongly downplay the benefits of lean red meat and advance an environmental agenda rather than promoting healthy choices based on \u201csound nutritional science.\u201dSeventy-one House lawmakers sent a letter Tuesday to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell expressing their disappointment over a recent report issued by the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. They said the report exceeded its scope in developing the recommendations.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cIt is extremely difficult to reverse or change public policy, once enacted, without causing consumer confusion,\u201d the letter states. \u201cInaccurate and conflicting dietary guidance messages are detrimental to consumer understanding of nutrition and the ability to build healthy diets.\u201dThe USDA and HHS will use the DGA advisory committee\u2019s report to write the final version of the 2015 dietary guidelines, expected by the end of the year.Political beefs over the guidelines have been growing on Capitol Hill, with the cattle and agriculture industries arguing that an environmental agenda has no place in a government blueprint for healthier living.The advisory committee has discussed sustainability as a good dietary goal, saying in its draft recommendations that there is \u201ccompatibility and overlap\u201d between what is good for health and what is good for the environment. It said that a diet higher in nuts and greens and lower in animal-based foods is \u201cmore health promoting and is associated with lesser environmental impact than is the current average U.S. diet.\u201dCurrent guidelines push lean meats as a healthy source of protein. The advisory panel, though, has debated whether lean meats should be included at all. The draft recommendations question whether a healthy dietary pattern includes fewer \u201cred and processed\u201d meats.The lawmakers behind the letter argue that the guidelines play a critical role for federal nutritional policy development and is the scientific basis for education and outreach. Therefore, they say, it is essential that they \u201cbe based on sound nutrition science and not stray into other areas outside of this specific discipline.\u201d\u201cI am asking the same question thousands of school kids in North Dakota and across America will be asking: \u2018Where\u2019s the Beef? Sacrificing sound science and denying the nutritional benefits of lean red meat to satisfy an extreme environmental agenda is woefully misguided,\u201d Rep. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said in a written statement.The March 31 letter states: \u201cWe are disappointed with reports from observers that the approach of the 2015 DGAC suggests studies were either selected or excluded to support pre-determined conclusions.\u201dMore than 100 environmental groups like Green America and the Sierra Club have come out in support of the recommendations. There have been ads purchased in daily newspapers that feature an open letter urging Burwell and Vilsack to adopt the changes.\u201cWhat we are seeing with the Dietary Guidelines is a rare consensus between the environmental, public health and nutrition communities,\u201d Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a written statement.The Associated Press contributed to this report.45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

    "Sign in to comment!By Walt BonnerThis undated photo provided by Thomas Chouvenc of the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (IFAS), shows young hybrid termite offspring eight months after the light-colored female Formosan termite, bottom right, mated with the darker male Asian termite, bottom left, in Florida. (AP Photo/Thomas Chouvenc, University of Florida/IFAS)Two of the world\u2019s most destructive termite species are swarming South Florida, and the fact that they are mating has scientists sweating.The Asian and Formosan subterranean termite species are producing hundreds of thousands of winged males and females (known as alates), which are in turn creating hybrid colonies, according to University of Florida entomologists. The two species are no joke, and hybrid colonies could prove even more disastrous for homeowners.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cThey are the two most destructive termite species in the world,\u201d University of Florida Entomology Professor Nan-Yao Su told FoxNews.com. \u201cThe common name for Formosan subterranean termite in China and Japan is \u2018house termite\u2019 as it can literally bring down a house, usually [starting] with [the] roof as they chew through the supporting beams.\u201dTermite colonies, sometimes consisting of millions of individuals, can live up to 20 years and thrive in South Florida, where the temperatures offer ideal mating conditions.Researchers previously believed that the two species had distinct swarming seasons that kept them apart, preventing the risk of interbreeding. However, they are now finding that there is an overlap in seasons in the south of the state, leading to the production of hybrid colonies.Apparently, the male Asian termites prefer Formosan females to that of their own species \u2013 a fact that, according to Professor Su, is due to pheromones. \u201cBoth species probably use [the] same chemical for mating,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the Formosan female probably produces more mating pheromone than [the] Asian subterranean termite female, hence the Formosan female becomes more attractive.  At least that is our working hypothesis.\u201dThe area of the species overlap extends from Miami (Dade County) to Riviera Beach (Palm Beach County).What makes the emergence of hybrid colonies so alarming is that they\u2019re reproducing at a rate that is more than twice as fast as the parent species. Known as \u201chybrid vigor,\u201d this offers a few troubling scenarios: that the hybrid colonies could reach maturity faster (two to three years, as opposed to the parent species maturing in five to six), or that they could form a much larger colony (5 million to 10 million termites per colony, as opposed to 2 million to 5 million).Either way, Su said, it\u2019s bad news: \u201cWe don\u2019t know if the hybrid individual can consume more wood, but these are parameters we need to study.  At any rate, any of one of these, if proven correct, could mean more destructive termites.\u201dThis doesn\u2019t only spell trouble for South Floridians. With the hybrid colonies reproducing at a much faster rate and growing to larger numbers, the possibility of them spreading to other states is that much greater.According to Su, this will depend on the hybrid\u2019s fertility. \u201cDue to its tropical distribution, Asian subterranean termites probably won\u2019t go any further than Palm Beach County.  If the hybrid offspring is sterile, then the hybrid population will most likely [be] restricted to South Florida.  However, if the hybrid offspring is NOT sterile, and it has the temperature tolerance of both parent species, then we may see them expanding from North Carolina to Brazil.\u201dThe Asian and Formosan termites are no strangers to world travel. The Formosan termite originated in China, but is now firmly entrenched in the southeastern U.S. Even more widespread are the Asian termites, which have managed to spread to Brazil and the Caribbean islands. The species invade foreign soil by hitching rides on wooden boats or by stowing away in shipped wooden crates.Currently, homeowners can use baits or apply insecticides in the dirt surrounding their houses to halt or prevent infestation. With the emergence of these new hybrid colonies, it may be time to stock up.",
    "Sign in to comment!Iran nuclear talks extend beyond deadlineSecretary of State John Kerry is sticking around for at least another day of tense talks over Iran's nuclear program, pushing negotiations into double overtime -- even as other foreign ministers were sitting it out and the White House repeated a threat that all sides are \"prepared to walk away.\"\"We continue to make progress but have not reached a political understanding,\" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said in a brief statement, revealing that Kerry would once again postpone his departure from the Switzerland talks and \"remain in Lausanne until at least Thursday morning to continue the negotiations.\"ADVERTISEMENTNegotiators already had blown past a Tuesday at midnight deadline to push talks into Wednesday. It remained unclear whether talks continuing into Thursday could yield a deal framework.German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said negotiators were still facing a \"tough struggle,\" indicating the talks were not likely to end anytime soon. \"Tonight there will be new proposals, new recommendations. I can't predict whether that will sufficient to enable an agreement to be reached,\" he said.At the same time, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif accused his country's negotiating partners, particularly the U.S., of having \"defective\" political will in the talks.\"I've always said that an agreement and pressure do not go together, they are mutually exclusive,\" he told reporters. \"So our friends need to decide whether they want to be with Iran based on respect or whether they want to continue based on pressure.\"The foreign ministers of China, France and Russia previously had departed Lausanne Tuesday night. With talks bleeding into Thursday, France's foreign minister reportedly was on his way back.But patience may be wearing thin.White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday that talks were \"making some progress\" but that \"we have not yet received the specific, tangible commitments we and the international community require.\"And he restated a threat that the U.S. and others are prepared to leave the table.\"We're going to drive a hard bargain and we're going to expect Iran to make serious commitments,\" he said. \"And we're going to give them the opportunity to do so.  But if they don't, the international community, alongside the United States, is prepared to walk away and consider some alternatives.\"The Obama administration has faced recent calls to do just that.Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., told Fox News he's concerned the framework of a deal could allow Iran keep its uranium stockpiles and continue to enrich uranium in an underground bunker.\"You have to be willing to walk away from the table and to reapply leverage to Iran,\" Cotton said. \"And the fact that they're not willing to do that, that we're still sitting in Switzerland negotiating when three of our negotiating partners have already left just demonstrates to Iran that they can continue to demand dangerous concessions from the West.\"Speaking on MSNBC, former Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean seemed to agree. He said that while President Obama is \"right\" to seek a deal, it might be time to \"step away\" from the table and make clear that the U.S. is not backing off key positions -- including on Iran's uranium stockpile and the pace of sanctions relief.The negotiators' intention is to produce a joint statement outlining general political commitments to resolving concerns about the Iranians' nuclear program in exchange for relief of economic sanctions against Iran. In addition, they are trying to fashion other documents that would lay out in more detail the steps they must take by June 30 to meet those goals.But Iran has pushed back not only on the substance of the commitments the sides must make but to the form in which they will make them, demanding that it be a general statement with few specifics.  That is politically unpalatable for the Obama administration which must convince a hostile Congress that it has made progress in the talks so lawmakers do not enact new sanctions that could destroy the negotiations.Zarif said the result of this round of talks \"will not be more than a statement.\"A senior Western official pushed back on that, saying that nothing about a statement had been decided and that Iran's negotiating partners would not accept a document that contained no details. The official was not authorized to speak to the negotiations by name and spoke on condition of anonymity.Deputy Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi named differences on sanctions relief as one dispute -- but also suggested some softening of Tehran's long-term insistence that all sanctions on his country be lifted immediately once a final deal takes effect.He told Iranian TV that economic, financial, oil and bank sanctions imposed by the U.S., the European Union and others should be done away with as \"the first step of the deal.\"Alluding to separate U.N. sanctions he said a separate \"framework\" was needed for them.Negotiations have already been twice extended since an interim agreement between Iran, the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany was concluded in 2013. President Obama and other leaders, including Iran's, have said they are not interested in a third extension.But if the parties agree only to a broad framework that leaves key details unresolved, Obama can expect stiff opposition at home from members of Congress who want to move forward with new, stiffer Iran sanctions. Lawmakers had agreed to hold off on such a measure through March while the parties negotiated. The White House says new sanctions would scuttle further diplomatic efforts to contain Iran's nuclear work and possibly lead Israel to act on threats to use military force to accomplish that goal.The Associated Press contributed to this report.45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

    "Sign in to comment!Federal grand jury indicts Sen. Robert MenendezA defiant N.J. Sen. Robert Menendez vowed Wednesday to fight corruption charges against him, hours after a federal grand jury handed up an indictment that accused the two-term Democrat of using his office to help a party donor.\u201cI am not going anywhere,\u201d Menendez said at an evening press conference in Newark. \u201cThis is not how my career is going to end.\u201dADVERTISEMENTMenendez, a powerful political force in New Jersey and a leading skeptic of the Obama administration\u2019s Cuba and Iran policies, was indicted on 14 counts, including conspiracy to commit bribery and wire fraud. He\u2019s accused of using his office to improperly benefit a political donor who allegedly offered the senator an array of perks, including trips on his private jet and access to an exclusive Dominican resort.The 61-year-old senator Wednesday night blasted what he called \u201cfalse allegations,\u201d which he said were being perpetuated \u201cby those who have a political motivation to silence me.\u201d\u201cBut I will not be silenced,\u201d he vowed. \u201cI\u2019m confident at the end of the day I will be vindicated and they will be exposed.\u201dThe Newark grand jury has been investigating Menendez for official actions he took on behalf of his friend Dr. Salomon Melgen. Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist, was also indicted Wednesday.The indictment, which comes as the U.S. and other world powers are struggling to strike a nuclear agreement with Iran, is a blow at a critical time to Menendez, who is the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and until recently was chairman. A person familiar with the matter confirmed to Fox News that Menendez will step down from his post and is \u201cdoing so temporarily and voluntarily.\u201dMenendez has acknowledged that he flew multiple times on Melgen\u2019s private jet to the Dominican Republic and initially failed to properly pay for the trips. In 2013, Menendez agreed to reimburse Melgen $58,500 for the full cost of two flights.The senator\u2019s office later disclosed another flight from Florida to New Jersey in 2011, and said Menendez had repaid Melgen $11,250 for it.Last year, Menendez disclosed that his campaign accounts had paid a law firm $250,000 for legal costs related to investigations by the Justice Department and the Senate Ethics Committee of his ties to Melgen.Menendez has also acknowledged taking actions that could benefit Melgen, among them contacting U.S. health agencies to ask about billing practices and policies.But the lawmaker has said he did nothing wrong and that he and Melgen have been friends for decades.\"We celebrated holidays together,\" he once told reporters. \"We have been there for family weddings and sad times like funerals and have given each other birthday, holiday and wedding presents, just as friends do.\"The indictment against Menendez also accuses the senator of accepting nearly $1 million worth of gifts between January 2006 and January 2013 as well as using the power of his Senate office to influence the outcome of \u201congoing contractual and Medicare billing disputes worth tens of millions of dollars to Melgen and to support the visa applications of several of Melgen\u2019s girlfriends.\u201dIn one incident, \u201cGirlfriend 3,\u201d a Ukrainian national who worked as a model and actress living in Spain at the time, was denied a tourist visa to visit Melgen in Miami. On Feb. 15, 2007, Menendez staffers wrote a letter to the consul general asking a non-immigrant visa for his friend.The indictment also claims Menendez stayed in an executive suite at the five-star Park Hyatt- Paris-Vendome on April 8, 2010 through April 11, 2010. The hotel stay was valued at $4,934.10. The government says Menendez solicited and accepted 649,611 American Express Membership Rewards points from Melgen to foot the bill. The government says Menendez asked his office manager to research Park Hyatt rates, and check to see if a government rate was available.Federal investigators also point to emails between him and former Chief Counsel, Kerru Talbot and a staffer with Customs and Border Patrol in \u200ewhich Talbot asked CBP not to donate screening equipment to the Dominican Republic, but instead to allow a private contractor controlled by Melgen to provide that equipment.Melgen came under renewed scrutiny when government data last year showed he had received more in Medicare reimbursements in 2012 than any other doctor in the country.Menendez becomes the first sitting U.S. senator to face indictment since then-Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, in 2008. Stevens was found guilty of concealing gifts from donors on financial disclosure statements, but the Justice Department later dropped the case after admitting that prosecutors failed to turn over evidence that would have been favorable to his defense.\"Senator Menendez\u2019s ethics lapses have long been a distraction to the United States Senate,\u201d Andrea Bozek, a spokeswoman with the National Republican Senatorial Committee said in a written statement. \u201cWith today's indictment, the FBI and the Justice Department made it clear that Senator Menendez has betrayed the trust of New Jersey families. His actions reinforce all that the American people believe is wrong with Washington Democrats and closes the book on a Senate Democrat majority that put their personal interests ahead of the American people.\"Menedez joined the Senate in 2006 after serving more than a decade in the House of Representatives.A lawyer and former mayor of Union City, New Jersey, Menendez also served in the New Jersey General Assembly and state Senate.Fox News' Jake Gibson, Kara Rowland, Nicole Busch and The Associated Press contributed to this report.45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

    "Sign in to comment!Researchers: Onions, garlic may kill MRSA superbugResearchers in Britain and the U.S. have found that a medieval concoction meant to treat eye infections also has the ability to kill the MRSA superbug.The Daily Telegraph reported that the recipe, which dates from the 10th century, calls for two species of Allium -- a scientific type that includes garlic, onion, and leek -- as well as wine and oxgall, or bile from the stomach of a cow.ADVERTISEMENTThe paper reports that the recipe specifically calls for the mixture to be brewed in a brass vessel, purified through a strainer, and left to sit for nine days before use.Dr. Christina Lee, a professor at the School of English at Nottingham University, recreated the treatment to see if it could work as a modern-day remedy. To her surprise, it not only cleared up styes, but also worked effectively against the potentially deadly superbug.The Telegraph reports that the mixture killed about 999 of 1,000 MRSA bacterial cells present in mice wounds. Dr. Kendra Rumbaugh of Texas Tech University, told the Telegraph that the 1,000-year-old remedy worked \"as good, if not better than\" traditional antibiotics.However, scientists still aren't sure why the remedy is so effective. Further experimentation showed that no single ingredient had a discernable effect on the superbug, leading researchers to believe that the particular combination of ingredients and brewing method hold the key.The Nottingham researchers are seeking additional funding to test the method on humans.Click for more from The Daily Telegraph.",

    "\u201cI hate firing people. My heart always wonders if I could have done more to make it work, or if I should have given them another chance. But my head knows that I cannot run a profitable business AND employ people who don\u2019t meet the standards of the company.\u201dAs harsh as that may sound, that leader is entirely correct. At some point it becomes obvious that a team member or colleague isn\u2019t making the cut, no matter how many opportunities they are given. And while we tend to look at firing someone in a negative light, it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be that way.It\u2019s true that delivering unwanted news to an employee will never be a fun job, but there are ways to frame it in a different, more positive light. Here is advice.Give them a reason. You don\u2019t need to go into minute details, but it can be helpful to offer constructive feedback as to why this decision was made.Remember, it\u2019s not just about firing someone who isn\u2019t a good fit for your company, it\u2019s also about being a part of their growth going forward.Leave room for questions. It\u2019s OK if they prefer not to, but you need to give them the opportunity to ask any questions they might have \u2013 and be prepared to answer them.Depending on your relationship with the individual, or the size of your company, you could offer to speak to them later, once they\u2019ve had a chance to process the news.It\u2019s all about context. People aren\u2019t always fired for negative reasons. It\u2019s possible that the person may be a fantastic individual and employee, but not a good fit for the job.If there are specific skills which they are unable to master, to leave them in the role would result in added stress and frustration for everyone involved. If appropriate, to help the individual find professional success \u2013 even if that means letting them go \u2013 follow your bad news with a good letter of reference to take with them.Accentuate the positive. It can be difficult to find encouraging things to say to someone you are firing, but it\u2019s important that you do more than simply hand them a pink slip.Give recognition of a successful project or a skill set they developed during their tenure. Don\u2019t overdo it in your praise \u2013 you\u2019re still letting them go \u2013 but do be genuine and forthcoming in acknowledging their positives attributes.Jeremy Kingsley is a professional speaker, best-selling author, and the President of OneLife Leadership.

    "You might think dogs are an unlikely source of inspiration for your customers, but you\u2019d be surprised how similar they can be. I don\u2019t mean to denigrate your customers! Quite the contrary. I think if customers were more like dogs in the following four ways, we\u2019d all have more business than we could handle.1. LoyaltyWhat\u2019s the first quality you think of when it comes to dogs? Loyalty! They\u2019re there with wagging tails, whether we feed them, walk them, or ignore them. And when we treat them well? That loyalty skyrockets.You already know that having loyal customers is great for business. It\u2019s easier\u2014and cheaper\u2014to get past customers to come back than to find new ones.  So consider ways you can build loyalty with your customer base.2. Managed ExpectationsWe all learned about the Pavlovian response for dogs in grade school. Do something enough and the dog will come to expect it, whether it\u2019s shaking the leash (walk!) or moving toward the food bag (dinner!). My dog assumes I want to take her for a walk whenever I put on shoes, and she\u2019s often disappointed, but that\u2019s neither here nor there.If you deliver an unpleasant experience, your customers will quickly assume that\u2019s what they should expect in the future, and they\u2019ll go elsewhere with their dollars. But if you reward them with over-the-top customer service and stellar products, they\u2019ll come back for more, as that will be what they expect from you.3. ObedienceDogs are actually harder to train than customers. You can\u2019t always communicate the benefit that they\u2019ll receive if they, for example, sit. It takes them a while to realize, \u201cHey, if I sit, she\u2019ll give me a tasty chicken treat!\u201dIn that same vein, if you strive to offer your customers the best, they\u2019ll do what you want. They\u2019ll open your emails and click the links. They\u2019ll buy more from you. Review you on Yelp. Tell their friends about you. Share your content on social media. Just show them the reason they should be obedient, and they\u2019ll do it.4. PredictibilityMy dog, Apple, is pretty predictible. She gets the zoomies around 7 p.m. and runs like a crazy beast for a while. Then she settles down on my son\u2019s bed at bedtime. I know her patterns and can work around them.The more time you spend paying attention to your customers, the more you\u2019ll be able to predict their behavior. If you know that you\u2019ve got a 30 pecent chance of getting a Yelp review from a new customer if you email them a link to your Yelp page within 24 hours, do it! If you know that customers are more likely to buy from you again 90 days after the initial purchase, make sure you\u2019ve got an email nurture campaign set up to accommodate.You love your customers, just like you love your dog if you have one. With a bit of love and nurturing, you can make the most of that relationship.More from AllBusiness.com:Susan Payton is the President of Egg Marketing & Communications, an Internet marketing firm specializing in marketing communications, copywriting and blog posts for the software industry.

    "Sign in to comment!File: May 22, 2013: Ex-IRS official Lois Lerner is sworn in on Capitol Hill, in Washington, D.C. (AP)The Justice Department has declined to pursue contempt of Congress charges against Lois Lerner for refusing to testify about her role at the IRS in the targeting of conservative groups.The department announced the decision in a letter Tuesday to House Speaker John Boehner, whose Republican-controlled chamber made the request to prosecute, after holding Lerner in contempt for refusing to testify at committee hearings.ADVERTISEMENT\"Once again, the Obama administration has tried to sweep IRS targeting of taxpayers for their political beliefs under the rug,\u201d Boehner spokesman Michael Steel told FoxNews.com.Lerner asserted her Fifth Amendment privilege, which allows people to not testify against themselves, during a May 2013 hearing of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and then again at a March 2014 hearing.However, House Republicans argued Lerner waived the privilege with an opening statement she made before the committee in the May 2013 appearance. All the chamber\u2019s Republican members and six Democrats officially voted in May 2014 to hold Lerner in contempt.Ron Machen Jr., the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said in the seven-page letter that federal prosecutors concluded Lerner did not waive her privilege because she made \u201conly general claims of innocence\u201d during the opening statement.\u201cThus, the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution would provide Ms. Lerner with an absolute defense should be prosecuted \u2026 for her refusal to testify,\u201d wrote Machen, who was appointed to the U.S. attorney post by President Obama and left for private practice Wednesday, one day after sending the letter.He also said he will not refer the case to a grand jury or take any other action to prosecute.Lerner ran the IRS\u2019s exempt organizations unit when Tea Party and other nonprofit groups with conservative names applying for tax-exempt status were targeted for additional auditing from April 2010 to April 2012.She was placed on administrative leave in May 2013 and retired four months later.\u201cI have not done anything wrong,\u201d Lerner said in her 2013 opening statement. \u201cI have not broken any laws. I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations. And I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee.\u201dThe IRS scandal broke in May 2013 when Lerner said at an American Bar Association gathering and during a follow-up conference call with reporters there was a \u201cvery big uptick\u201d in nonprofit applications and that the vetting process was limited to the agency\u2019s Cincinnati office.However, the extent to which the Obama administration knew about the targeting, beyond Lerner\u2019s unit in Washington, remains unclear in part because, she says, her computer crashed and emails were lost.Lerner attorney William Taylor said he and is client are \u201cgratified but not surprised\u201d by the decision by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\u201cAnyone who takes a serious and impartial look at this issue would conclude that Ms. Lerner did not waive her Fifth Amendment rights.\u201d he said. \u201cIt is unfortunate that the majority party in the House put politics before a citizen\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201dSteel also said the White House still has the opportunity to \u201cdo the right thing and appoint a special counsel to examine the IRS\u2019 actions.\"Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan said federal prosecutors made the \u201cwrong\u201d decision.\u201cAs one of his final acts as U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., Ronald Machen used his power as a political weapon to undermine the rule of law,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cMachen was legally bound to convene a grand jury, but instead he ignored his obligation and unilaterally decided to ignore the will of the House. \u2026 This is wrong, and a great example of why so many Americans distrust their government.\u201d45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

    "By Todd Starnes, Fox NationNow that a rampaging mob of liberals has bullied the state of Indiana into submission, I want to direct your attention to what they're trying to do to a Navy Chaplain.Wes Modder is a 19-year veteran of the military based at an officer's training school in South Carolina. This man once ministered to our Navy SEALs. But now he is  facing what could be the end of his highly decorated military career.A gay officer filed a complaint against Chaplain Modder, accusing him of failing to show tolerance and respect in private counseling sessions. The officer was specifically upset about Modder's Christian beliefs.Chaplain Modder is endorsed by the Assemblies of God, a denomination that believes premarital sex is a sin, as well as homosexual behavior. The officer took offense  and accused Modder of discrimination.Now Congress is getting involved. Nearly three dozen lawmakers sent a letter to the Secretary of the Navy demanding answers. I have an exclusive copy of that letter.The lawmakers point out that the Catholic Church and the Southern Baptist Convention hold the same beliefs on marriage and homosexuality that the Assemblies of God hold, writing this:\"It is dangerous to fall prey to the fundamentally false proposition that individuals who support natural marriage can only be motivated by animus for others.\"The Navy seems to regard chaplains as glorified summer camp counselors, dispensing secular platitudes and lollipops. Folks, this smells like a set-up. Why else would a gay officer who's married to another man seek out an evangelical chaplain for advice?It seems to me if you take offense at the counsel of a Christian chaplain, don't go to a Christian chaplain.Watch Todd Starnes' American Dispatch above and sound off!=====================================================================Todd Starnes is host of Fox News & Commentary, heard on hundreds of radio stations.

    "Sign in to comment!April 1, 2015: Nigerian former Gen. Muhammadu Buhari speaks to journalists in Abuja, Nigeria. (AP)ABUJA, Nigeria \u2013  Nigerians celebrated Muhammadu Buhari's electrifying victory in presidential elections Wednesday but sobering challenges confront their next leader, from an Islamic uprising to widespread poverty and graft.Buhari, 72, made history in Africa's most populous country as the first opposition party candidate to win elections, ending President Goodluck Jonathan's bid for another term. For a former major general who three decades ago led Nigeria following a coup, it was an amazing transformation to a democratically elected president.ADVERTISEMENTFresh from his victory, Buhari warned the country's Boko Haram Islamic insurgents that he'd be coming after them.\"No doubt this nation has suffered greatly in the recent past and its staying power has been challenged to its limits, chief among them the insurgency of Boko Haram,\" he said Wednesday at Abuja's international conference center where he received a certificate attesting to his victory. \"Boko Haram will soon know the strength of our will and commitment to rid this nation of terror ... we shall spare no effort until we defeat terrorism.\"Boko Haram aims to establish a caliphate and to turn Nigeria into an Islamic state, has killed thousands of civilians and carried out frequent kidnappings but has been hit hard in recent weeks by troops from Nigeria and allied forces from neighboring Chad, Cameroon and Niger.The bespectacled president-elect also warned that corruption would not be tolerated after he takes office on May 29. As Nigeria's leader three decades ago, he returned looted state assets. Government workers arriving late to work were even forced to perform squats. His regime executed drug dealers.\"Corruption attacks and seeks to destroy our national institutions and character ... distorts the economy and creates a class of unjustly enriched people,\" Buhari said Wednesday, wearing splendid white robes with gold embroidery. \"Such an illegal yet powerful force soon comes to undermine democracy because it has amassed so much money that they believe they can buy government.\"Buhari had ruled Nigeria for less than 20 months before being deposed in another coup in 1985, with another major general saying Buhari had been slow to overcome the nation's economic problems.It may be deja vu for Buhari when he takes over the presidency because the economy, Africa's biggest, is suffering again because of low oil prices. Nigeria is Africa's biggest oil exporter and the government is heavily dependent on oil sales for its revenues. The 2015 budget had to be slashed because of slumping oil prices. The value of the local naira currency is also dropping.Jonathan's party has governed since military dictatorships ended in 1999. Buhari has been trying to be president since then and this was his fourth run at the presidency.New scanners to confirm voters' biometric identity cards are credited with reducing voting fraud, which had been a factor in previous elections. However some of the machines did not work at about 300 of the 150,000 polling stations.Jonathan conceded with grace late Tuesday, saying \"I promised the country free and fair elections. I have kept my word.\"In a continent where there have been cases in which a sitting president refused to accept defeat at the polls and violence resulted -- Ivory Coast in 2011 is an example -- the turn of events in Nigeria was good news that was welcomed by many Nigerians and foreign leaders alike.In the northern city of Kaduna, thousands celebrated in the streets, shouting \"No Boko Haram! No Boko Haram!\" The demonstrators danced and held up posters of Buhari and waved brooms, his symbol to sweep out corruption. Motorbikes and cars did stunts and dozens climbed onto a police car as police looked on.\"President Jonathan has placed his country's interests first by conceding the election and congratulating President-Elect Buhari on his victory,\" U.S. President Barack Obama said in a statement. \"I look forward to working with President Jonathan throughout the remainder of his term, and I thank him for his many years of service and his statesmanlike conduct at this critical juncture.\"Jonathan's concession has defused tensions and fears of post-election violence. Some 1,000 people died and 65,000 were made homeless in riots in the Muslim north after Buhari lost to Jonathan in 2011. Results from Saturday's election show Buhari winning votes across religious, tribal and geopolitical lines.Because of decades of military rule this was only the eighth election in Nigeria's history and the fifth since democracy was restored in 1999.",

She was a stand-up comic taping interviews for the second episode of a call-in podcast. One of those callers identified himself only as \u201cJohn, about 24,\u201d and morosely acknowledged having blown a small fortune.Peretti: How much is a small fortune? Ten grand?Holdzkom: No. When I was 18 the New York Mets gave me $210,000.Peretti: Wooooah. Why?Holdzkom: Because they thought I was a good baseball player.The Amazin\u2019s had picked the 6-foot-9 Holdzkom in the fourth round of the 2006 draft, mainly on the strength of a blazing fastball that let him strike out over a batter an inning for his first three seasons in the minors.Peretti: And then what happened? You started sucking at baseball?Holdzkom: Um, I did. I\u2019m not going to lie. I wasn\u2019t as good as I thought I was, and my arm wasn\u2019t as healthy as I thought it was.He spent that signing bonus on a Ford F-150 and rounds of sushi, but ended up needing Tommy John surgery in 2008. After posting a 9.00 ERA in rookie ball \u2013 he allowed 10 walks in just five innings \u2013 Holdzkom got released in 2010. He didn\u2019t pitch in 2011, had a tryout with the Reds the next year, then washed out again. Soon after, he picked up the phone.Peretti was impressed by Holdzkom\u2019s honesty. He owned his mistakes, from the drinking to the cockiness. That turned to humility when he talked on the podcast about how excited he was to get a shot at winter ball in the remote baseball outpost of Australia.Peretti: I feel you have a lot of potential. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve gotten your life back on track. I think you\u2019re going to go to the majors after Australia.Funny thing is, the funny woman was right.

    "Sign in to comment!ATLANTA \u2013  Eleven former Atlanta Public Schools educators accused of participating in a test cheating conspiracy that drew nationwide attention were convicted Wednesday of racketeering charges.A grand jury indicted 35 educators in March 2013 on charges including racketeering, false statements and theft. Only one of the 12 educators on trial was acquitted of the racketeering charge; verdicts on the theft and false statements charges were mixed.ADVERTISEMENTProsecutors claimed the former educators participated in a conspiracy to cheat on standardized tests dating back to 2005, motivated by pressure to meet federal and APS standards and receive bonuses or keep their jobs. Many reached plea agreements, and some testified at the trial.The educators said they faced pressure from supervisors \u2014 including former Superintendent Beverly Hall \u2014 to inflate students' scores to show gains in student achievement.Hall was supposed to be tried along with the others, but her lawyers successfully argued she was too sick to help her own defense. She died last month from complications of breast cancer.Prosecutors said the 12 former educators on trial were looking out for themselves, seeking bonuses for higher test scores rather than worrying about the education of the children they were charged with teaching. Defense attorneys said their clients were caught up in an overly broad prosecution that overreached in charging them with violating racketeering laws most often used for organized crime.The entire process was lengthy: The months-long trial began in August with more than six weeks of jury selection, and testimony concluded in late February. The criminal investigation by the Fulton County district attorney's office lasted nearly two years.The investigation involved at least 50 schools as well as hundreds of interviews with school administrators, staff, parents and students. The district has about 50,000 students.The cheating came to light after The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that some scores were statistically improbable.A state investigation in 2011 found widespread cheating on annual state exams that were used to determine whether schools met the federal No Child Left Behind law, with ties to extra funding. Investigators reported cheating in 44 schools with nearly 180 educators involved. They said Hall and her top staff \"created a culture of fear, intimidation and retaliation\" that threatened teachers or other educators who tried to report it.Hall served as superintendent for more than a decade, which is rare for an urban schools chief. She was named Superintendent of the Year by the American Association of School Administrators in 2009 and credited with raising student test scores and graduation rates, particularly among the district's poor and minority students. But the award quickly lost its luster as her district became mired in the scandal.In a video message to schools staff before she retired, Hall warned that the state investigation launched by former Gov. Sonny Perdue would likely reveal \"alarming\" behavior.\"It's become increasingly clear that a segment of our staff chose to violate the trust that was placed in them,\" Hall said. \"There is simply no excuse for unethical behavior and no room in this district for unethical conduct. I am confident that aggressive, swift action will be taken against anyone who believed so little in our students and in our system of support that they turned to dishonesty as the only option.\"",
    "By ERIC TUCKER and SEAN CARLIN | APWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Sen. Bob Menendez, the son of Cuban immigrants who rose to become one of the highest-ranking Hispanic members of Congress, was charged Wednesday with accepting nearly $1 million worth of gifts and campaign contributions from a longtime friend in exchange for a stream of political favors on the donor's behalf.A federal grand jury indictment accuses the New Jersey Democrat of using the power of his Senate seat to benefit Dr. Salomon Melgen, a wealthy Florida eye doctor who prosecutors say provided the senator with luxury vacations, airline travel, golf trips and tens of thousands of dollars in contributions to a legal defense fund.The indictment from a federal grand jury in Newark charged the senator with 14 counts, including bribery, conspiracy and false statements, over his ties to Melgen. Melgen also was charged in the case.The criminal charges cloud the political future of the top Democrat \u2014 and former chairman \u2014 of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who has played a leading role on Capitol Hill on matters involving Iran's nuclear program and U.S. efforts to improve ties with Cuba. A person familiar with Menendez's situation, who was not authorized to discuss the senator's plans publicly, said Menendez would voluntarily and temporarily step aside from his role as top Democrat on the committee.Menendez, who has repeatedly asserted his innocence, was expected to make a statement later Wednesday in New Jersey. Melgen's attorney did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday.The indictment could lead to a drawn-out legal fight between Menendez and a team of Justice Department corruption prosecutors who have spent the last two years investigating his ties to Melgen. The dispute will require prosecutors to establish that a close and longtime friendship between the men was used for illicit purposes and is likely to present questions about whether Menendez is shielded by the Constitution from prosecution over the legislative acts he performed.The indictment from a grand jury in his home state was the latest development in a federal investigation that came into public view when federal authorities raided Melgen's medical offices in 2013. It depicts a relationship in which gifts such as round-trip flights to the Dominican Republican were quietly traded for favors such as political intervention in medical billing and contractual disputes.Among the allegations is that Melgen provided Menendez with free trips to the Dominican Republican aboard his luxury jet and that the senator, between 2007 and 2012, never disclosed the gifts he received from the doctor.In exchange for those and other gifts, prosecutors say, Menendez tried to influence immigration proceedings of Melgen's foreign girlfriends, sought to protect a lucrative contract Melgen held to provide cargo screening services to the Dominican Republic and intervened in a Medicare billing dispute on the doctor's behalf worth millions of dollars.Menendez has acknowledged taking actions that could benefit Melgen, among them contacting U.S. health agencies to ask about billing practices and policies. But the lawmaker has said he did nothing wrong and that the interactions he had with the doctor are reflections of a friendship of two decades.\"We celebrated holidays together,\" he once told reporters. \"We have been there for family weddings and sad times like funerals and have given each other birthday, holiday and wedding presents, just as friends do.\"Melgen came under renewed scrutiny when government data last year showed he had received more in Medicare reimbursements in 2012 than any other doctor in the country.According to the Senate Historical Office, Menendez is the 12th senator to be indicted and the first since the late Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, was indicted in 2008 on charges of not reporting hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of home renovations. Stevens was convicted but the charges were later dismissed.Menendez is also the second New Jersey senator to be indicted. Harrison Williams Jr., a Democrat, was indicted in 1980 on corruption charges and convicted of bribery and other counts the following year. Williams resigned before the Senate could vote on whether to expel him.Menendez, 61, joined the Senate in 2006 after serving more than a decade in the House of Representatives. A lawyer and former mayor of Union City, New Jersey, Menendez also served in the New Jersey General Assembly and state Senate.___Associated Press writers Sean Carlin in Newark and Alan Fram in Washington contributed to this report.Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.

    "Sign in to comment!By Edmund DeMarcheMarch 26: Miami Marlins' Giancarlo Stanton follows through with a home run in the first inning of an exhibition spring training baseball game against the St. Louis Cardinals. (AP)If Giancarlo Stanton is to be the face of the Miami Marlins, fans will have to look behind the customized mask he's been approved to wear, after a cringe-inducing beanball ended the season of Major League Baseball's highest paid player last year.The black, carbon-fiber face protector features a \"G\" that will cover the left side of Stanton's face, which was badly injured last Sept. 11 when a fastball from Milwaukee Brewers' pitcher Mike Fiers struck him, causing multiple fractures, lacerations, and dental damage. The sickening video went viral, and raised questions about whether Stanton would even play again. But doctors said his vision would not be affected, and although Stanton, who was on an MVP pace with 37 home runs and 105 runs batted in, did not return last season, in November, he signed a 13-year, $325 million contract extension.ADVERTISEMENTA spokesman from the team told FoxNews.com in an email that Stanton will wear the mask during the regular season. Major League Baseball took to Twitter in February and gave the nod of approval, \u201cYeah, @Giancarlo818\u2014The faceguard plays.\u201d Stanton has already been sporting the unique device in spring training games.The Miami Herald reported that the protective gear can withstand a 100-mph fastball. Stanton, who flew up to the helmet facility, helped design the gear, the report said.NBA all star Rudy Tomjanovich, (l.), wore a facemask after a devastating injury from a punch during a 1977 game, and Steve Yeager, a former catcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers, had a customized throat protecter made for him after a broken bat pierced his neck in a 1976 game. (AP, Donruss)\"He would stand there and mimic his batting stance and look to see if his site-line was obstructed at all,\" a spokesman for Schutt Sports, the guard's manufacturer, told the paper.It is not uncommon for athletes to wear customized protective gear, especially after injuries. Pro basketball star Rudy Tomjanovich wore a full face mask after being seriously injured when Los Angeles Lakers forward Kermit Washington threw a devastating punch at him in a 1977 game. Since then, players including current stars Kobe Bryant and LeBron James have worn masks covering their faces. Los Angeles Dodgers catcher Steve Yeager had a specially-designed throat protector made for him after a broken bat pierced his neck in a 1976 game.Stanton's gear is the first time a player will wear a customized piece of equipment with a personalized flare.While the device may protect Stanton from future beanballs, there may be some debate about it, given that some pitchers believe anything that allows a batter to crowd the plate without fear of being hit by a pitch could confer an unfair advantage. So far, no known objections have been raised.A Marlins spokesman said Stanton has no financial agreement with the company.",

    "Sign in to comment!By Elizabeth HarringtonA redesign of a transparency website that provides information on federal spending by the Obama administration now makes it much more difficult to see how taxpayer dollars are spent.Usaspending.gov, a website mandated by law to provide detailed information on every federal contract over $3,000, received a makeover on Tuesday. Users can no longer search federal spending by keywords, sort contracts by date, or easily find detailed information on awards, which are delivered in bulk.ADVERTISEMENTInformation, such as how much the Pentagon spends on Viagra, used to be available at the click of a button. Locating those same contracts on the new website is virtually impossible, akin to finding a needle in a haystack.In its previous form, the website provided easy access to how taxpayer dollars are spent, as it happens. A user now must have the federal grant identification number to see details of a contract.Click for more from the Washington Free Beacon.45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

She said her son apologized to the teacher and deleted the post, but was still suspended.Shelby County district officials, however, called the incident \"inappropriate use of electronic media.\"School spokesman Christian Ross told FoxNews.com the students were not disciplined for posting the photo and said their three-day suspension was changed to one day.\"The reason they received disciplinary action was not because they were sharing the image on social media,\" Ross told FoxNews.com. \"The reason was because they were using district computers -- not personal cell phones -- to access inappropriate websites and content not related to the lessons that day.\"",

    "Sign in to comment!By Dr. John R. Lott Jr.French Red Cross members pay tribute March 28, 2015, to the victims of a Germanwings plane crash in front of a stone slab erected as a monument in Le Vernet, France. (AP Photo/Claude Paris)There has been a lot of second-guessing about Andreas Lubitz, the Germanwings co-pilot who deliberately crashed his plane into the French Alps, killing himself and 149 others. If only Lufthansa had regular mental evaluations of pilots, if only people at the airline knew what obvious signs to look for, this tragedy could have been avoided.But psychiatrists know that isn\u2019t true. It isn\u2019t just fellow workers who fail to pick up the supposed subtle hints that indicate that someone might be a danger to themselves or others. \u201cWe have no indication what could have led the co-pilot to commit this terrible act,\u201d said Carsten Spohr, Lufthansa\u2019s chief executive.ADVERTISEMENTPsychiatrists themselves have a very poor record. Identifying mental illness is a long way from thinking that the person poses a danger. Look at the inability of psychiatrists to identify mass shooters. It\u2019s very common for mass killers to be seeing psychiatrists before their attacks, including Elliot Rodger (Santa Barbara), Ivan Lopez (the most recent Fort Hood shooter), Adam Lanza (Sandy Hook elementary school), James Holmes (Aurora, Colo., movie theater), and Seung-Hui Cho (Virginia Tech).Rodger had already been receiving top-quality mental-health counseling for years. Indeed, one of his psychiatrists, Dr. Charles Sophy, is nationally known and medical director for the LA County Department of Children and Family Services.The Army psychiatrist who last saw Lopez found no \u201csign of likely violence, either to himself or to others.\u201d While Holmes\u2019 psychiatrist warned University of Colorado officials about his patient\u2019s violent fantasies, she \u201crejected the idea\u201d that the threat was sufficiently serious for him to be taken into custody.Seung-Hui Cho was deemed \u201can imminent danger to himself as a result of mental illness.\u201d Nonetheless, he was determined not to be \u201can imminent danger to others as a result of mental illness.\u201d The judge stated that it was not necessary to have him involuntarily committed.Again, these prominent mass killers certainly didn\u2019t lack mental health care. The problem was that even good psychiatrists failed to identify real threats.Psychiatrists have strong incentives to get the diagnosis right. Besides their own professional pride and desire to help, they have legal obligations to inform authorities of threats. Holmes\u2019 psychiatrist was sued by the families of victims.It can be very difficult for mental-health professionals to accept that their patients may pose a serious violent threat. Indeed, they tend to deny it to themselves.The problem is severe enough that there is a whole academic literature devoted to it. It has been suggested that psychiatrists become desensitized to danger or try to prove their fearlessness. It\u2019s possible that added training may help improve diagnoses of unusual cases.However, it\u2019s simply hard to predict these extremely rare outcomes.Monday morning quarterbacking is always easy. What seem like obvious telltale signs in retrospect are often not so obvious before the attack, even to the experts.There is also the risk of placing too much stigma on mental illness. Extremely few mentally ill people go on to become mass killers. Even among schizophrenics, the rate is much lower than one person out of every 100,000.There are no cheap or easy answers. If someone poses a true danger to others, why not lock them up? Or provide outpatient caregivers to monitor them?No one wants a dangerous person to have a weapon. But our mental-health system can\u2019t be the last line of defense. There are just too many mistakes.John R. Lott, Jr. is a columnist for FoxNews.com.

It got a downgrade this week; I really don't care.Obviously, it's not for the faint of heart. If you can buckle up and take the next ride, $340 to $350 area, takes you to $500.Longer term, I do think this can be a $600 stock.

There is a belief they are an Iranian proxy, we know the Houthis hate the Saudis \u2026 there is a danger the Saudi attack on the Houthis could drive them to the Iranians.\u201dWhile Saudi Arabia has led an air campaign, there are indications a ground strategy won\u2019t be effective against the rebels.\u201cThe Yemenis are much better fighters than the Saudis \u2026 they know the terrain [and] the Saudis have a relatively weak army so they rather substitute air power in which they a greater advantage against the Houthis,\u201d said Phillips, who sees a reliance on airstrikes as the \u201cprimary engine\u201d for Saudi intervention.There are concerns if the Saudi-led coalition can\u2019t quell violence in Yemen, it could spill over into their borders.\u201cThe Shiite Houthi rebels could enflame instability among the Saudi Shiite minority communities.

He is not a varsity player.\"He's earned the letter just like any other varsity athlete has,\" Kelley said.His mother praised his coaches and the quality of his education and reiterated that her issue is only with the policy. She told KSN-TV Friday that her adopted son is a one-of-a-kind kid who loves to play basketball.She bought him a varsity letter that is the same as the one worn by East High\u2019s varsity basketball team that just won the state championship. Kelley said Michael was told he couldn\u2019t wear his letter jacket and was given a girl\u2019s sweatshirt to wear instead.Ken Thiessen, the principal of East High School in Wichita, wrote an open letter after the story\u2019s coverage on Friday. He said the school stands by its record on building character and its programs for students with special needs.He said if the league decides to change the letter design to make it identical, he would support the measure.\"Our administrators, our teachers and staff, as well as our entire student body, value ALL of our students. This is continually demonstrated in our activities, our celebrations, our honors and the daily way our school conducts itself,\" his statement said, according to KAKE.com.The Associated Press contributed to this report",

    "Sign in to comment!The Oscar-nominated foreign film \"Wild Tales,\" released in U.S. theaters over the weekend, has had a disclaimer added to it due to similarities between an opening sequence and last week's plane crash in the French Alps that killed 150 people.The Curzon Theater chain added the following language to their website after many noted the eerie similarities between one of the scenes and the reports that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz deliberately crashed his plane into the mountains.ADVERTISEMENTDisclaimer: Following the Germanwings flight incident on Tuesday 24th March, please be aware that WILD TALES features a sequence that some customers might find disturbing.Similar language is now being shown in some theaters before the film.\"Wild Tales\" is a portmanteau film with six storylines that each share revenge themes. In one [SPOILER ALERT] a man tricks a planeload of people who have wronged him into the same flight, locks himself in the cockpit, and crashes the plane into his parent's house. Scenes of people trying to break down the cockpit door and screaming at the pilot resemble audio retrieved from the Germanwings' flight's black box of the flight's pilot trying to break down the door and stop Lubitz.\"Wild Tales\" received rave reviews when it was released, and was also nominated for the Palm D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 2014.Advertisement",
    "Sign in to comment!Iran nuclear talks extend beyond deadlineSecretary of State John Kerry is sticking around for at least another day of tense talks over Iran's nuclear program, pushing negotiations into double overtime -- even as other foreign ministers were sitting it out and the White House repeated a threat that all sides are \"prepared to walk away.\"\"We continue to make progress but have not reached a political understanding,\" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said in a brief statement, revealing that Kerry would once again postpone his departure from the Switzerland talks and \"remain in Lausanne until at least Thursday morning to continue the negotiations.\"ADVERTISEMENTNegotiators already had blown past a Tuesday at midnight deadline to push talks into Wednesday. It remained unclear whether talks continuing into Thursday could yield a deal framework.German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said negotiators were still facing a \"tough struggle,\" indicating the talks were not likely to end anytime soon. \"Tonight there will be new proposals, new recommendations. I can't predict whether that will sufficient to enable an agreement to be reached,\" he said.At the same time, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif accused his country's negotiating partners, particularly the U.S., of having \"defective\" political will in the talks.\"I've always said that an agreement and pressure do not go together, they are mutually exclusive,\" he told reporters. \"So our friends need to decide whether they want to be with Iran based on respect or whether they want to continue based on pressure.\"The foreign ministers of China, France and Russia previously had departed Lausanne Tuesday night. With talks bleeding into Thursday, France's foreign minister reportedly was on his way back.But patience may be wearing thin.White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday that talks were \"making some progress\" but that \"we have not yet received the specific, tangible commitments we and the international community require.\"And he restated a threat that the U.S. and others are prepared to leave the table.\"We're going to drive a hard bargain and we're going to expect Iran to make serious commitments,\" he said. \"And we're going to give them the opportunity to do so.  But if they don't, the international community, alongside the United States, is prepared to walk away and consider some alternatives.\"The Obama administration has faced recent calls to do just that.Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., told Fox News he's concerned the framework of a deal could allow Iran keep its uranium stockpiles and continue to enrich uranium in an underground bunker.\"You have to be willing to walk away from the table and to reapply leverage to Iran,\" Cotton said. \"And the fact that they're not willing to do that, that we're still sitting in Switzerland negotiating when three of our negotiating partners have already left just demonstrates to Iran that they can continue to demand dangerous concessions from the West.\"Speaking on MSNBC, former Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean seemed to agree. He said that while President Obama is \"right\" to seek a deal, it might be time to \"step away\" from the table and make clear that the U.S. is not backing off key positions -- including on Iran's uranium stockpile and the pace of sanctions relief.The negotiators' intention is to produce a joint statement outlining general political commitments to resolving concerns about the Iranians' nuclear program in exchange for relief of economic sanctions against Iran. In addition, they are trying to fashion other documents that would lay out in more detail the steps they must take by June 30 to meet those goals.But Iran has pushed back not only on the substance of the commitments the sides must make but to the form in which they will make them, demanding that it be a general statement with few specifics.  That is politically unpalatable for the Obama administration which must convince a hostile Congress that it has made progress in the talks so lawmakers do not enact new sanctions that could destroy the negotiations.Zarif said the result of this round of talks \"will not be more than a statement.\"A senior Western official pushed back on that, saying that nothing about a statement had been decided and that Iran's negotiating partners would not accept a document that contained no details. The official was not authorized to speak to the negotiations by name and spoke on condition of anonymity.Deputy Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi named differences on sanctions relief as one dispute -- but also suggested some softening of Tehran's long-term insistence that all sanctions on his country be lifted immediately once a final deal takes effect.He told Iranian TV that economic, financial, oil and bank sanctions imposed by the U.S., the European Union and others should be done away with as \"the first step of the deal.\"Alluding to separate U.N. sanctions he said a separate \"framework\" was needed for them.Negotiations have already been twice extended since an interim agreement between Iran, the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany was concluded in 2013. President Obama and other leaders, including Iran's, have said they are not interested in a third extension.But if the parties agree only to a broad framework that leaves key details unresolved, Obama can expect stiff opposition at home from members of Congress who want to move forward with new, stiffer Iran sanctions. Lawmakers had agreed to hold off on such a measure through March while the parties negotiated. The White House says new sanctions would scuttle further diplomatic efforts to contain Iran's nuclear work and possibly lead Israel to act on threats to use military force to accomplish that goal.The Associated Press contributed to this report.45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

    "Sign in to comment!New book reveals Weather Underground secretsThis is a rush transcript from \"The Kelly File,\" March 30, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ADVERTISEMENTDINESH D'SOUZA, FILMMAKER OF \"AMERICA\": The thing to realize is that guys like Ayers, even if they don't have an official position on the campus, are now beginning -- they have moved out. They've moved out of the universities now into the high schools and into the elementary schools.(END VIDEO CLIP)MEGYN KELLY, HOST: That was filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza on our \"The Kelly File\" special \"Who is Teaching our Kids?\" talking about how a number of former domestic terrorists decided to sort of abandon their protest movement in favor of instead teaching the next generation in classrooms around this country. And tonight a new book reveals the story of one more, Ronald Fliegelman was a bomb maker for the Weather Underground taking on the role after three members of the group managed to blow themselves up trying to make a bomb. Fliegelman admits to working of the 1970 bombing of the NYPD headquarters, and soon after took on a new gig, teaching children in the New York City public schools. The author that broke this story joins me now.Bryan Burrough is a special correspondent at Vanity Fair. And the author of \"Days of Rage: America's Radical Underground, the FBI, and the Forgotten Age of Revolutionary Violence.\"Bryan, great to see you. Wow. So obviously we had a long exchange with Professor Ayers and documented not only his history as a domestic terrorist but his stint as a college professor getting a state paycheck from the, you know, big brother against whom he railed. This is another example of it. I mean, the guy he's still getting the taxpayer dollars.BRYAN BURROUGH, SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT, VANITY FAIR: He is. As a matter of fact, it's funny. If you go back and look at the most senior ten to 12 members of the Weather Underground leadership, I would say eight or nine ultimately entered education.KELLY: How do they do that?BURROUGH: Well, I think the better question is how do they not do that? One of the problems with the Weather Underground is there were no successful prosecutions afterwards. So there's really, well, I can understand the moral outrage so many people might have at this, there's really no legal reason to stop it. These people had not been charged with crimes. And the crimes that we now know they did commit, the Statute of Limitations had long gone passed.KELLY: This guy Fliegelman, he bombed among other things the Pentagon. We talked about that with Ayers. He was the one who made the bomb.BURROUGH: He says he can't remember. I think I'm about 99 percent sure he built the bomb.KELLY: Uh-huh.BURROUGH: He told me that in the six years that he built bombs for the Weather Underground they might have done two or three actions without him, but that he built everything else.KELLY: So he bombs the Pentagon among other places, according to you, you believe that based on your research. And he spoke to you as well as many others of the Weather Underground did as well.BURROUGH: Yes.KELLY: And then he goes underground, right? And as Bill Ayers did and others did. Does anybody ever come calling? Did the cops ever try to bring a case against him or knock on his door?BURROUGH: No, absolutely not. When the Weather Underground kind of imploded in 1976 and 1977, many of its members simply returned to ordinary life. In Fliegelman's case, he returned to his parent's house in Philadelphia and to the job that he'd left, to go Underground in 1969, teaching under-privilege children. Six years later he began teaching in the New York City schools.KELLY: Unbelievable. And still getting a pension, $40,000 a year. Does he know Ayers? What does he think of Ayers?BURROUGH: I don't believe I asked him his opinion of Bill Ayers.KELLY: How about the other members of the Weather Underground?BURROUGH: Well, one of the things you find in interviewing alumni of Weather and the other underground groups is there's a good deal of resentment toward the handful all the people who attracted all the attention in the media. First and foremost, Bill Ayers. There's a feeling and I can't necessarily personally ascribe this to Ron, but there's a feeling among some of these people that we built the bombs, we took the risk and they're out there getting the credit.KELLY: Oh, I see. The beef that they have with them. Now, one other thing, this book puts the lie to something Bill Ayers told me. And here's the clip.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: You realize people could have been hurt. You admitted it in the beginning.BILL AYERS, CO-FOUNDER, WEATHER UNDERGROUND: I said people could have been hurt and thank God they weren't. And we made every attempt not to and they weren't.KELLY: But do you appreciate the recklessness of that?AYERS: I don't say it wasn't reckless.KELLY: Who are you to potentially endanger the lives of those individuals who may have been in or around those buildings?AYERS: I don't say it wasn't reckless and I don't say it wasn't illegal. It was illegal. We cross lines of legality --KELLY: It's not about legality.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: He made every attempt not to hurt people.BURROUGH: Turned out to be not so true. The question actually is two answers. There were two phases of the Weather Underground. What Bill Ayers does not want us to know because he just doesn't, is that for the first three months of the existence in early 1970, in fact the Weather Underground did set out to kill people, policemen. It made several attempts including one that I disclosed for the first time in the book to kill policemen. What happened unfortunately was they managed to blow themselves up first.  And this necessitated in a change in tactics. And that led to the second phase of the Weather Underground that Bill Ayers refers to which did not attack and attempt to kill people. It was largely protest bombings at the Capitol, the Pentagon and buildings like that late at night that by and large did not injure or wound people.KELLY: Wow, Bryan Burrough, I recommend the book to everybody. Again, it's called \"Days of Rage\" and it comes out a week from today.BURROUGH: Yes.KELLY: All right. A week from today. You can preorder it right now, Amazon.com.

    "It's important to point out about the Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act -- that we make sure it's \u201capples to apples\u201d-- when talking about the Federal law and 19 other state laws.The Indiana law *is* different... more broad than all others ... except South CarolinaLaw: Religious Discrimination Statute Compared to Other RFRABRIEF: Indiana's religious freedom law sets a standard by which cases involving religious objections will be judged. The law says the government cannot intrude on a person's religious liberty unless it can prove a compelling interest in imposing that burden and do so in the least restrictive way.Indiana's law differs from the federal version and the 19 other state RFRAs in the following ways:*** First, the Indiana law explicitly allows any for-profit business to assert a right to \"the free exercise of religion.\" The federal RFRA doesn't contain such language, and neither does any of the state RFRAs except South Carolina's.Sec. 5. As used in this chapter, \"exercise of religion\" includes any exercise of religion,whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.Sec. 7. As used in this chapter, \"person\" includes the following: (1) An individual. (2) An organization, a religious society, a church, a body of communicants, or a group organized and operated primarily for religious purposes. (3) A partnership, a limited liability company, a corporation, a company, a firm, a society, a joint-stock company, an unincorporated association, or another entity that: (A) may sue and be sued; and (B) exercises practices that are compelled or limited by a system of religious belief held by: (i) an individual; or (ii) the individuals; who have control and substantial ownership of the entity, regardless of whether the entity is organized and operated for profit or nonprofit purposes.*** Second,  the Indiana law contains a provision about rights which have yet to be burdened. The federal RFRA doesn't contain such languageSec. 9. A person whose exercise of religion has been substantially burdened, or is likely to be substantially burdened, by a violation of this chapter may assert the violation or impending violation as a claim or defense in a judicial or administrative proceeding, regardless of whether the state or any other governmental entity is a party to the proceeding.*** Third, the Indiana law provides a defense in a private suit where the government is not a party. The circuits are split as to whether RFRA can be claimed as a defense in citizen suits-suits solely between private citizens in which the government is not a party.Sec. 9. A person whose exercise of religion has been substantially burdened, or is likely to be substantially burdened, by a violation of this chapter may assert the violation or impending violation as a claim or defense in a judicial or administrative proceeding, regardless of whether the state or any other governmental entity is a party to the proceeding. If the relevant governmental entity is not a party to the proceeding, the governmental entity has an unconditional right to intervene in order to respond to the person's invocation of this chapter.*** Fourth, many of the states with a RFRA law also have a law that prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation. Indiana does not have o a state-wide law.In Indiana, about a dozen cities, including Indianapolis, have local nondiscrimination laws that specifically protect gays and lesbians in employment, housing, education and public accommodation, which include business transactions. But in much of Indiana there is no such protection.20 States with Religious Freedom Restoration Acts: Alabama, Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia.Religious freedom states that have nondiscrimination laws protecting gays, lesbians and bisexuals: Connecticut, Illinois, New Mexico, Rhode Island.Religious freedom states with cities or towns that have non-discrimination ordinances that include either sexual orientation and/or gender identity protections with respect to employment and public accommodation: Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas.Iraqi's defense minister declared a \"magnificent victory\" over the Islamic State group in Tikrit today and added that security forces had accomplished their mission in the month long offensive to crush the terrorists.Missed the All-Star Panel on Special Report with Bret Baier?

    "Sign in to comment!By Howard KurtzKurtz: Elizabeth Warren's state of denialHas it come to this? We\u2019re now begging Elizabeth Warren to run for president.Are journalists so determined to slow down the Hillary coronation that they will badger and beseech the freshman senator until she runs just to stop the media torture?ADVERTISEMENTFolks, this is getting embarrassing.How many times does Warren have to say she is not pursuing the presidency before we take her at her word? How many different ways does she have to word her denials?Sure, a woman-on-woman contest for the Democratic nomination would be fascinating to cover in a country that has had 44 male presidents. But read my lips: Not. Going. To. Happen.When Warren makes Shermanesque disavowals in dozens of interviews, why does each journalist think that this time there will be a different result?This has to transcend the desire for a horse race. Some pundits\u2019 hearts simply beat faster when the Massachusetts Democrat talks about taking on Wall Street and battling special interests. The prospect of her launching a liberal crusade in 2016 excites them in ways that Hillary\u2019s cautious, establishment-oriented approach does not \u2014 even more so in the wake of the email furor.Take the Boston Globe, whose editorial page has openly urged its home-state gal to take the plunge:\u201cDemocrats would be making a big mistake if they let Hillary Clinton coast to the presidential nomination without real opposition, and, as a national leader, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren can make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. While Warren has repeatedly vowed that she won\u2019t run for president herself, she ought to reconsider\u2026\u201cA presidential campaign would test Warren as never before. Her views on foreign policy are not fully formed. And on many other important issues \u2014 climate change, gun control, civil rights \u2014 Warren could struggle to articulate clear differences between herself and Clinton. That\u2019s a risk she should be willing to take.\u201dIn other words, run, Liz, run!Which brings us to the \u201cToday\u201d show. Warren has been making the rounds to promote the paperback edition of her book, and swatting away the inevitable question. Savannah Guthrie would not give up.She began: \u201cYou didn\u2019t think you\u2019d get away with this interview without my asking you point-blank: Are you going to run for president?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI\u2019m not running and I\u2019m not going to run.\u201dThe senator said she had a great job and wants to fight for such issues as student loans, medical research and the minimum wage. But Guthrie was not to be deterred.\u201cLet me make sure that we underscore this and maybe bold it and put it in all caps\u2026It has seemed you were hedging a little bit in the past. I don\u2019t hear you hedging now. Are you saying unequivocally, I am not running for president in 2016?\u201dWarren started laughing. \u201cI\u2019m not running. I\u2019m not running,\u201d she said.Guthrie tried another angle: Warren was the \u201cperfect person\u201d to push these middle-class issues, but her supporters are \u201cafraid Hillary Clinton won\u2019t give voice to these issues that you care about.\u201dWarren wouldn\u2019t take the bait and didn\u2019t mention Hillary in her answer. So Savannah tried again: Is Hillary \u201cthe right messenger\u201d?\u201cI think we need to give her a chance to decide if she\u2019s going to run,\u201d said Warren, who obviously knows Hillary is running.That must have been it, right? Uh uh.\u201cPossibly I\u2019m beating a dead horse here,\u201d Guthrie said, admitting the obvious, \u201cbut did you ever even entertain, consider the possibility, of running for president?\u201dThe answer: no.Guthrie was doing her job, trying to prod Warren into uttering a newsworthy sound bite rather than just repeating her talking points and plugging her book.As in romance, Warren is more desirable for being unobtainable. Mitt Romney went through the same thing, with the press badgering him about running a third time, until he said he might, whereupon the same press ripped him for being a bad candidate. And many forget that Warren had a rocky campaign when she won her Senate seat.Elizabeth Warren\u2019s dogged denials on \u201cToday\u201d should end this question once and for all. But journalists, who are in denial, will keep on asking.Click for more Media Buzz45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved.

    "McDonald's Corp. (MCD) plans to raise pay by more than 10% and add benefits like paid vacation for workers at U.S. restaurants it operates, an effort to rejuvenate the struggling fast-food giant that offers fresh evidence of rising wage pressure in the American labor market.Starting July 1, McDonald's will pay at least $1 per hour more than the local legal minimum wage for employees at the roughly 1,500 restaurants it owns in the U.S. The increase, which McDonald's said will apply to some 90,000 workers at all levels of experience and rank, will lift the average hourly rate for its U.S. restaurant employees to $9.90 on July 1 and more than $10 by the end of 2016, from $9.01 currently. McDonald's also will enable workers after a year of employment to accrue up to five days of paid time-off annually.The changes come amid mounting criticism from labor groups over wages and conditions at McDonald's and other fast-food chains. The move doesn't apply to employees of the franchisees who operate nearly 90% of the 14,350 U.S. McDonald's--a fact critics may seize on. McDonald's says franchisees are free to set their own pay policies. The company said it does plan to make subsidies for some education costs available to all U.S. workers as part of its plan.McDonald's Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook, who took over on March 1, said the policy is a response to employee surveys and is central to his plans to revive sales after more than two years of declines. \"What we need to underpin that is highly motivated teams in our restaurants,\" he said in an interview. \"Motivated teams deliver better customer service and delivering better customer service in our restaurants is clearly going to be a vital part of our turnaround.\"The move follows similar efforts by other major U.S. employers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which is raising hourly pay for 500,000 workers to at least $10 next year, and reflects wider public pressures over income inequality as well as intensifying competition for low-skilled workers.From a year earlier, average hourly earnings for non-manager employees at limited-service restaurants like McDonald's rose 3.5% in January to $9.54 an hour, according to Labor Department data, well above 2.2% pace for all private-sector workers.Historically, stronger pay increases are somewhat unusual at this stage in the business cycle for lower-skilled workers, who typically are the last to see better wage gains. The increases could reflect some payback after several years of wages barely keeping pace with inflation, or could indicate that skilled-workers who resorted to restaurant jobs in the economic downturn are now seeking better paying work.Better pay among lower-skilled workers has the potential to \"bubble up\" through the economy, said Patrick O'Keefe, an economist at CohnReznick LLP. Raising starting wage will likely boost wages of others within a given company. Also, more money in workers' pockets should provide a boost to consumer spending and aid overall economic expansion.\"The underlying motivation is a response to market conditions,\" said Mr. O'Keefe, a former Labor Department official. \"The firms that have announced very publicly that they're raising their entry wage are signaling that to attract the quality of labor they're looking for, they have to be more competitive.\"The federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour hasn't increased since 2009, although 29 states have set minimums above the federal level, as have cities such as San Francisco, which requires pay of at least $11.05 an hour. Efforts in Congress to increase the pay floor stalled last year. But more large employers raising wages could set a \"de facto\" minimum wage that is higher than the federal floor, said University of Michigan economist Donald Grimes.McDonald's announcement is unlikely to satisfy its strongest critics, who have been calling for much larger increases and demanding the company take responsibility for pay and other policies at its franchisees. Fast Food Forward, a group backed by the Service Employees International Union, has helped organize nationwide protests at McDonald's and other chains demanding a $15 hourly minimum and the right to form a union without employer backlash. The next round of protests is scheduled for April 15, according to organizers. McDonald's said the protests weren't a factor in its decision.The move could put pressure for similar increases on McDonald's franchisees, powerful stakeholders that the company carefully manages its relationships with. McDonald's sets many requirements in agreements with its franchisees but doesn't govern their wages and benefits, and it is currently fighting complaints by the National Labor Relations Board's general counsel last year that claim McDonald's has sufficient control over its franchisees' operations to make it a joint employer responsible for the rights of franchisees' workers.Mr. Easterbrook said the franchisees are \"experts...at setting the right pay levels in their local markets.\" Asked if McDonald's would consider requiring them to enhance pay or benefits in future contracts, he said \"absolutely not.\"Write to Annie Gasparro at annie.gasparro@wsj.com and Eric Morath at eric.morath@wsj.comAccess Investor Kit for McDonald's Corp.Visit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US5801351017Access Investor Kit for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.Visit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US9311421039Subscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwiresCopyright \u00a9 2015 Dow Jones Newswires+ FollowFox Business on Facebook",

(AP Photo/Brendan Smialowski, Pool)While American voters split over the nuke deal being negotiated with Iran, they agree on one thing: Iran can\u2019t be trusted.A new Fox News poll also finds there\u2019s widespread agreement that President Obama should get sign-off from Congress before inking the deal.ADVERTISEMENTThree-quarters of voters, 76 percent, say Obama \u201cshould be required\u201d to get Congressional approval for any deal he makes with Iran about its nuclear program. That includes nearly two-thirds of Democrats (64 percent).CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTSMost think Iran can\u2019t be trusted. Over half of voters, 55 percent, say the U.S. \u201ccan\u2019t trust anything\u201d Iran says on the issue of nuclear weapons, while another 28 percent thinks we can only trust \u201ca little\u201d of what Iran says.Just one percent thinks the U.S. can \u201ccompletely trust\u201d Iran on nukes, while 15 percent of voters say we \u201ccan trust some\u201d of what it says.Republicans (72 percent) are nearly twice as likely as Democrats (39 percent) to think the U.S. can\u2019t trust anything Iran says.Overall, by a 47-44 percent margin, voters favor an agreement that would involve the U.S. easing economic sanctions on Iran for 10 years and in return Iran agreeing to stop its nuclear program during that time.A 58-percent majority of Democrats favors the deal, while a 55-percent majority of Republicans opposes it. Independents oppose it by a slim 4-point margin.Obama hit a new low of 33 percent approval on his handling of the Iran situation. Fifty-eight percent of voters disapprove. The previous record low was 35 percent approval vs. 53 percent disapproval in January 2014.The March 31 deadline for reaching a deal with Iran over its nuclear program passed, but the administration said negotiations would continue beyond an original extension of Wednesday and now go through at least Thursday. There are plans to continue talking through a late June deadline.The talks with Iran have put the United States at odds with Israel. The White House opposed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressing Congress earlier this month -- just before that country\u2019s elections. The poll finds more American voters than not are glad Netanyahu won, yet the largest number, 39 percent, say they don\u2019t care much either way about his re-election.Republicans (56 percent) are four times as likely as Democrats (15 percent) to say they are glad Netanyahu won re-election.Meanwhile, approval of Congress is out of the teens for only the second time in nearly four years. Twenty-one percent of voters approve today, which matches its February rating. It was 20 percent in June 2011. Even so, disapproval remains high today, as 7 in 10 give lawmakers the thumbs down (70 percent).The Fox News poll is conducted by telephone with live interviewers under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R). The 1,025 registered voters were reached via landline and cell phone numbers randomly selected for inclusion in this nationwide survey from March 29-31, 2015. The full poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved.

    "Sign in to comment!By Viknesh Vijayenthiran(AP)Porsche\u2019s hottest Boxster at present is the 330-horsepower GTS but by the end of the year the German automaker will have this baby in showrooms: the all-new Boxster Spyder, making its debut this week at the 2015 New York Auto Show. A successor to the 2011 Boxster Spyder, as well as a tribute to the 718 Spyder from the 1960s (notice those delicious rear humps behind the headrests), the latest car retains the unique and unmistakable character of the previous incarnations and injects it with some serious performance.For example, the classic roadster top is still opened and closed by hand, and the car is only available with a manual transmission, benefiting both weight savings and driver enjoyment. But behind those seats sits a massive\u2014for the Boxster\u20143.8-liter flat-six tuned to deliver 375 horsepower. That\u2019s just 10 hp shy of the engine\u2019s output in thenew Cayman GT4, a track-focused model from which many of the Boxster Spyder\u2019s components have been lifted.ADVERTISEMENTThis includes a firm sport suspension with a 20-millimeter lower ride height, a more aggressive aero kit with larger intakes, uprated brakes and more direct steering. The size of the steering wheel has also been reduced to 360 mm across (down from 370 mm) to ensure the car can be driven precisely and with great agility. The standard seats are Porsche\u2019s grippy Sport Seats Plus.In line with the model\u2019s traditional roadster character, neither a radio nor an air conditioner is included to help shed a few extra pounds. However, both can be ordered as optional equipment at no cost. You can also add most of the Boxster\u2019s regular options such as a satellite navigation system and communications package.So what kind of performance numbers are we looking at? Porsche quotes a 0-60 mph time of just 4.3 seconds and a top speed of 180 mph.The Porsche Boxster Spyder reaches showrooms in October, as a 2016 model, and is priced from $83,095. The car\u2019s hard-top sibling, the Cayman GT4, is on sale in July, priced from $85,595. Both prices include a $995 destination charge.For more from the 2015 New York Auto Show, head to our dedicated show hub.",

    "Sign in to comment!OCt. 31, 2014: Photo of members of Nigeria's Islamic extremist group Boko Haram, Islamic extremists from Nigeria attacked a border town inside Niger, marking the 2nd foreign country attacked by the group in several days. (AP)BERLIN \u2013  The U.N.'s human rights chief said Wednesday his office has received reports that Boko Haram fighters retreating from advancing military forces in Nigeria murdered women and girls they had taken as \"wives,\" along with other captives.The recapture of parts of northeastern Nigeria in recent weeks \"has brought to light gruesome scenes of mass graves and further evident signs of slaughter by Boko Haram,\" Zeid Raad al-Hussein told a special session of the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva.ADVERTISEMENTZeid gave no further details of what he said were multiple reports of fighters killing \"their so-called 'wives' \u2014 in fact, women and girls held in slavery \u2014 and other captives.\" Boko Haram's reported use of children as \"expendable cannon fodder\" and human bombs would, if confirmed, constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity, he said.Zeid said there also are \"persistent and credible reports\" of serious rights violations by Nigerian and other security forces responding to Boko Haram. He called for \"thorough and fully transparent investigations\" by authorities.The Islamic extremist militants have terrorized northern Nigeria and also attacked towns in neighboring countries, prompting nations in the region including Chad and Niger to put together a force to combat them.Zeid said he is \"profoundly concerned about the growing ethnic and sectarian dimensions of the conflict.\"Boko Haram's original leader was from the Kanuri ethnic group, and the U.N. human rights office has received reports \"indicating that Kanuris are now considered suspect by some military personnel,\" resulting in arbitrary arrests and abuse, Zeid said.Boko Haram, meanwhile, has begun targeting Nigerians of Shuwa Arab origin \"apparently in retaliation for their perceived support to the Nigerian armed forces,\" he said.\"There is thus a high risk of escalating ethnic and religious violence,\" Zeid said. \"This can only be halted by principled leadership and clear instructions to military personnel, with appropriate accountability.\"",
    "Sign in to comment!Report: Sen. Bob Menendez to face federal corruption chargesA defiant Sen. Robert Menendez declared, \u201cI am not going anywhere,\u201d Friday night as the Justice Department prepares to charge the New Jersey Democrat with corruption counts over allegations he used his office to help a Democratic donor.The Justice Department is expected to bring criminal charges against him in the coming weeks, following a federal grand jury purportedly finding Menendez took official action on behalf of himself and that he received gifts from wealthy friend Dr. Salomon Melgen.ADVERTISEMENTThe government also alleges that Menendez and \u200ehis staff advocated on Dr. Melgen's behalf in a meeting among the senator, Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid and then-Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.The government also points to emails between former Menendez chief counsel Kerru Talbot and a staffer with Customs and Border Patrol in \u200ewhich Talbot purportedly asked the agency not to donate screening equipment to the Dominican Republic, but instead to allow a private contractor controlled by Melgen to provide that equipment.Menendez said at a press conference Friday, about four hours after the reports of the charges surfaced, that he had \u201calways conducted (his self) appropriately and in accordance with the law. I fight for things I believe important \u2026 and for the people of our country,\u201d he also said. \u201cThat\u2019s who I am. I am not going anywhere.\u201dMenendez took no questions from reporters, saying that because of the \u201congoing inquiry\u201d he could not make any additional comments. His office has not confirm the grand jury investigation and forthcoming charges but has defended the senator's conduct.In a statement, Menendez spokeswoman Tricia Enright said: \"As we have said before, we believe all of the senator's actions have been appropriate and lawful and the facts will ultimately confirm that.\u201cAny actions taken by Senator Menendez or his office have been to appropriately address public policy issues and not for any other reason.\"Attorney General Eric Holder has also declined to comment on the case when asked by Fox News. And President Obama ignored shouted questions by reporters Friday as he departed from Marine One following a trip to South Carolina.Menendez has been a leading critic of the direction of current diplomatic talks with Iran over its nuclear program and has helped draft legislation meant to check the administration's power to negotiate a deal.As the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee -- and a Cuban-American lawmaker -- he also has criticized the administration's efforts to normalize ties with Cuba.According to CNN, which first reported Justice Department charges, investigators looked at a plane trip the senator took as Melgen's guest to the Dominican Republic.They also looked at how Menendez allegedly advocated for him with Medicare officials who accused him of over billing and allegedly pushed his friend's business interests in the Dominican Republic.The New Jersey Law Journal, late last month, also reported on court documents in the case, which reportedly were posted by accident for a brief time. The publication said an appeals court has ordered a hearing into whether Menendez' aides can be compelled to testify to a grand jury in the case. The Law Journal, citing the court documents, said the case revolves around the billing dispute Melgen had with Medicare officials and the donor's deal to sell port-screening equipment to the Dominican Republic.Enright said Friday that Melgen is one of Menendez' closest friends but they cannot specifically address the claims.\"The two have spent holidays together and have gone to each other's family funerals and weddings and have exchanged personal gifts. As has been reported, the start of this investigation is suspect,\" she said. \"We know many false allegations have been made about this matter, allegations that were ultimately publicly discredited. We also know that the official investigation of this matter is ongoing, and therefore cannot address allegations being made anonymously.\"Various allegations indeed have swirled around the New Jersey lawmaker, including that he solicited prostitutes in the Dominican Republic -- allegations that have not been substantiated.The Justice Department's record of going after high-level lawmakers is mixed.They have won convictions against several House members, including former Republican Rep. Rick Renzi and former Democratic Rep. Bill Jefferson. But the late Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, had his conviction vacated over prosecutorial misconduct. They also never went after Alaska Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, despite claims they were considering it years ago.Fox News' Chad Pergram, Jake Gibson and Jodie Curtis and The Associated Press contributed to this report.45%50%21%70%\u00a92015 FOX News Network, LLC.

    "Sign in to comment!Busted. Clever flyer finds a way to catch a snooping seatmate. (YouTube/James Grande)If you\u2019ve ever had the sneaking suspicion that someone is looking over your shoulder while you're on your computer mid-flight, take note\u2014they probably are. But it can be pretty difficult to catch someone in the act.One airline passenger was online during a recent flight, minding his own business, when he noticed his seat partner glancing his way.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cI was on the Internet chatting with friends on Facebook,\u201d writes YouTuber James Grande. \u201cAnd THIS guy would not STOP being nosey.Grande says that every time he slightly turned his head, the snooper would quickly turn away, pretending to gaze out the window.Instead of confronting the man directly, Grande decided to use the Mac application Photobooth, which allows users to record video in real time from a laptop camera. Leaving the app hidden, Grande continues to chat with friends and browse, capturing the fellow passenger shamelessly gazing at his laptop screen-- not just once but three times.\u201cI hope you find this as funny as I do,\u201d the YouTuber writes in his clip, which is cleverly edited with imaginary thought bubbles.So did the snooper ever stop staring? Halfway through the video, it appears he actually puts on glasses for a better look. But the YouTuber finally gets the last laugh after exposing the overly curious seatmate.Check out the full clip for a laugh at 30,000 feet.",

    "Sign in to comment!March 30, 2015: Independent National Electoral Commission chairman, Attahiru Jega, left, views election results at the coalition center in Abuja, Nigeria, Monday. (AP/Sunday Alamba)ABUJA, Nigeria \u2013  Hundreds of Nigerian civil societies say discrepancies in election tallies suggest the turnout was inflated in defeated President Goodluck Jonathan's southern strongholds.The differences do not invalidate the victory of former military dictator Muhammadu Buhari but should be investigated before April elections for state governors, the Transition Monitoring Group told a news conference Wednesday.ADVERTISEMENTThe group's count has Buhari winning 59.4 percent of votes, instead of the official 53.9 percent, to 39.2 percent for Jonathan, instead of the official 45 percent.Some 40.6 percent of voters turned out in Nigeria's south-south zone compared to an official 55.9 percent, said the group that includes more than 400 civil society groups and which has monitored every election since years of military dictatorship ended in Nigeria in 1999.The south-south includes populous, oil-rich states like Rivers, which remains under curfew after opposition protests and the bombing of an electoral commission office following Saturday's bitterly contested election. Two opposition supporters and a soldier were gunned down there on election day.The Independent National Electoral Commission said it is investigating a slew of complaints about the election in Rivers state, including that officials from Jonathan's government and party substituted polling officials and that official results sheets went missing. Jonathan's campaign has denied any wrongdoing.The alleged rigging affected five southern states and apparently occurred between the count at polling stations, which their agents monitored, and collation at ward and then local government levels before results were sent for the final tally in Abuja, the capital, Lazarus Apir, the monitoring group's program manager, told The Associated Press.Observers' reports from 2011 elections indicated votes for Jonathan were inflated by some 2 million in the south, but nothing was done because it did not affect the outcome.\"If they (electoral officials) don't weigh in on this now, someone may be able to repeat that same manipulation during the governorship elections\" in April, Lazarus said."
